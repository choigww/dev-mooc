    "\n",
    "In the last mission, we covered CPU bounds, and showed how they can limit the performance of your program. We analyzed numerous algorithms, and figured out their performance characteristics. **One good way to model a program is as a set of inputs, actions, and outputs.** Here's a simple program that reads in a database file, a CSV file, and a text file, processes them, and creates a report:\n",
    "\n",
    "![io-bounds-1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/168/report_assembly.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This only involves reading and writing data at the very beginning and very end of the program. But imagine that we're working with a very large dataset that doesn't fit into memory. As we did in an earlier mission, we might need to use the database to do some processing, and to read in data periodically.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a text file of teams from [Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball). We want to calculate statistics on each team, but the raw statistics are too large to load into memory. We instead want to use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) to compute the statistics, then get the results. So we'd loop over the team names, then run a SQL query for each team to get the statistics we want. It would look something like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the above example, some of the tasks are CPU bound, and some are I/O bound. CPU bound tasks are tasks where our Python program is executing something.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**CPU bound tasks** will:\n",
    "* Execute faster if you **optimize the algorithm**.\n",
    "* Execute faster if your **processor has a higher clock speed** (can execute more operations).\n",
    "\n",
    "**I/O bound tasks** are tasks where:\n",
    "* Our program is **reading from an input** (like a `CSV` file).\n",
    "* Our program is **writing to an output** (like a `text` file).\n",
    "* Our program is **waiting for another program to execute** something (like a `SQL query`).\n",
    "* Our program is **waiting for another server to execute** something (like an `API request`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, during I/O bound tasks, your program **isn't using the CPU at all**, because it isn't executing any operations -- it's just waiting around for something else to finish. I/O bound tasks can be optimized, but the process is different from CPU bound tasks. In this mission, we'll learn how to improve the performance of I/O bound tasks.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As we work through this mission, we'll use a SQLite database of baseball statistics from [Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball), or MLB, an American baseball league. If you're unfamiliar with baseball, you can read the rules [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_rules). The data originally came from [Sean Lahman's site](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/), and was transformed to a SQLite database [here](https://github.com/jknecht/baseball-archive-sqlite).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each table in the dataset contains statistics on baseball players from `1871` to `2015`. Some tables contain statistics on pitching, others on fielding, others on awards players earned, and so on.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The important tables are:\n",
    "* `Master` -- contains information about players (including names)\n",
    "* `Batting` -- contains information on batting by year.\n",
    "* `Pitching` -- information on pitching by year.\n",
    "* `Fielding` -- information on fielding by year.\n",
    "* `AwardsManagers` -- which managers of teams won awards by year.\n",
    "* `AwardsPlayers` -- which players won awards by year.\n",
    "* `Teams` -- contains information on teams by year.\n",
    "* `Salaries` -- salary data for each player by year, starting in `1985`.\n",
    "* `HallOfFame` -- information about when players were inducted into the Hall of Fame, which honors the best baseball players of all time.\n",
    "* `Managers` -- information on managers of teams.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a previous screen, you may recall that our output looked strange because we used the `print` function in multiple threads.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the system standard output like a person taking orders at a deli. If people line up, and only one person orders at a time, the order they got into your deli will determine the order in which you make their sandwiches:\n",
    "\n",
    "![deli-order-example](../img/2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The person who got in fifth will get their sandwich after the person who got in fourth, and so on. But what happens when there's no line, and everyone is shouting their order at you? You can try to guess how the orders should be arranged based on when you heard their orders:\n",

    "\n",
    "This is exactly what happens with the `print` function and the system standard output. The output, like `BAL` is written to the standard output, then the output is flushed, with a newline character. This is why you see inconsistent spacing and team names running together, like this:\n",
