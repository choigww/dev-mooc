    "\n",
    "In the past few missions, we learned about I/O bound and CPU bound programs. We also learned about threads, processes, and in which situations to use each. In this mission, we'll bring everything together, and learn how to process a dataset using what we've learned.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using a dataset of movie quotes during this mission. The quotes are taken from the scripts of `1068` movies, and constitute `894014` lines altogether, and take up `56` megabytes of disk space. Although we want these examples in this mission to execute quickly for learning purposes, limiting dataset size, the techniques we'll be using can be scaled up to much larger datasets easily.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The movie lines are either [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) memorable quotes, or lines surrounding memorable quotes. The number of lines we have for each movie doesn't necessarily correspond to the length of the movie. The dataset originally came from [Cornell](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html), but has been modified to be easier to work with.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is `1068` different text files, one for each movie. All of the files are stored in the folder `lines`. Each text file contains all of the lines we have for the movie, separated by a newline character (`\\n`). Here's an example for [The Princess Bride](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/), which is an excerpt from `theprincessbride.txt`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.\n",
    "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\n",
    "Stop saying that!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each file also has some relatively messy artifacts, such as stray punctuation or other lines. Here's another example, again from `theprincessbride.txt`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --\n",
    " -- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it\n",
    " Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --\n",
    " -- so that every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish -- every babe that weeps at your approach, every woman who cries out, \"Dear God, what is that thing?\" will echo in your perfect ears.\n",
    " --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 119.\n",
    " That is what \"to the pain\" means. It means I leave you in anguish, wallowing in freakish misery forever.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll have to figure out a way to deal with the stray punctuation as we progress through the mission. For now, let's just load in a couple of the text files and familiarize ourselves with the structure of the data."

    "## The Concurrent Futures Package\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past two missions, we used the [threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) and [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) packages to utilize threads and processes, respectively. While both of these packages are widely used, and give you more low-level control, Python 3 introduced a new package, called **[concurrent.futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html), that enables you to create pools of threads and workers**. The main advantage of the `concurrent.futures` package is that it gives you a **simple, consistent, interface for both threads and processes**. We'll use it in this mission to make switching between threads and processes easy.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create pools of threads using the [concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor) class. Here's an example:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "pool = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10)\n",
    "lengths = pool.map(word_length, [\"Hello\", \"are\", \"you\", \"thinking\", \"of\", \"becoming\", \"a\", \"polar\", \"bear\", \"?\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the [concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor.map()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Executor.map) method returns a [generator](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators), and not a list, as we might expect from using `multiprocessing`. We just need to call `list(lengths)` to force the generator to evaluate.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can easily swap between threads and processes -- to switch from a worker pool that uses a thread for each worker to a pool that uses a process for each worker, just swap `ThreadPoolExecutor` for [concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/concurrent.futures.html#processpoolexecutor):\n",

Let's use a regular expression or substitution to remove all of the non-alphanumeric characters. We'll also lowercase the words, so that `Hey` and `hey` aren't seen as different.<br>\n",
