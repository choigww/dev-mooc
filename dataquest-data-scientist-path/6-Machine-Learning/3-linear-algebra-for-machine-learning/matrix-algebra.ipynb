    "## Determinant For Higher Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we discuss how to compute the matrix inverse for higher dimensional matrices, let's dive deeper into the determinant and introduce some more terminology. So far, we've mostly worked with matrices that contain the same number orws and columns. These matrices are known as **square matrices** and we can only compute the determinant and matrix inverse for square matrices. In addition, we can only compute the matrix inverse of a square matrix when the determinant is not equal to $0$.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the determinant of a higher dimensional square matrix, we need use the more general form of the determinant. Here's what that looks like:\n",

    "\n",
    "The determinant of a higher-dimensional system involves breaking down the full matrix into **minor matrices**. First, we select a row or column (most teaching materials select the first row). For the first value in that row, we \"hide\" the other values in that row (2nd and 3rd value in the row) and in that column (2nd and 3rd value in the column), select the rest of the elements as the minor matrix, and multiply the scalar value with the determinant of the minor matrix. We repeat this for the remaining values in the first row. This diagram helps illustrate this much clearer:\n",
