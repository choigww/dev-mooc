    "This validation process, where we use the training set to make predictions and the test set to predict values for, is known as train/test validation. Whenever you're performing machine learning, you want to perform validation of some kind to ensure that your machine learning model can make good predictions on new data. While train/test validation isn't perfect, we'll use it to understand the validation process, to select an error metric, and then we'll dive into a more robust validation process later in this course.\n",

Once we have the predicted price values, we can compare with the true price values and start to understand the model's effectiveness in the next screen.\n",
