    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a powerful and popular machine learning technique. The basic concept is very similar to trees you may have seen commonly used to aid decision-making. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram above, we're deciding whether we should wrestle a bear that's in front of us. We're using various criteria to make our final decision, including the size of the bear, and whether escape is possible. Let's say we had a data set of people who survived bear encounters and the actions they took:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Bear name    Size    Escape possible?    Action\n",
    "Yogi         Small   No                  Wrestle\n",
    "Winnie       Small   Yes                 Wrestle\n",
    "Baloo        Large   Yes                 Run away\n",
    "Gentle Ben   Large   No                  Wrestle\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to optimize our chances of surviving a bear encounter, we could construct a decision tree to tell us what action to take.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As our data set gets larger though, this becomes less and less practical. What if we had 10000 rows and 10 variables? Would you want to look through all of the possibilities to construct a tree?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the decision tree machine learning algorithm can help. It enables us to automatically construct a decision tree that tells us what outcomes we should predict in certain situations.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm -- we first construct the tree with historical data, and then use it to predict an outcome. One of the major advantages of decision trees is that they can pick up nonlinear interactions between variables in the data that linear regression can't. In our bear wrestling example, a decision tree can pick up on the fact that you should only wrestle large bears when escape is impossible, whereas a linear regression would have had to weight both factors in the absence of the other.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use trees for classification or regression problems. In this lesson, we'll walk through the building blocks of making a decision tree automatically.\n"

    "## Converting Categorical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see in our data, we have categorical variables such as `workclass` that have string values. Multiple individuals can share the same string value. The types of work include `State-gov`, `Self-emp-not-inc`, `Private`, and so on. Each of these strings is a label for a category. Another example of a column of categories is `sex`, where the options are `Male` and `Female`.<br>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "One strategy is to convert the columns to a [categorical](https://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/categorical.html) type. Under this approach, pandas will display the labels as strings, but internally store them as numbers so we can do computations with them. The numbers aren't always compatible with other libraries like Scikit-learn, though, so it's easier to just do the conversion to numeric upfront.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the [Categorical.from_array](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15.2/generated/pandas.core.categorical.Categorical.from_array.html) method from pandas to perform the conversion to numbers."

    "1. To compute it, we first calculate the entropy for $T$. \n",
    "2. Then, for each unique value $v$ in the variable $A$, we compute the number of rows in which $A$ takes on the value $v$, and divide it by the total number of rows. \n",

    "Here's an alternate explanation. We're finding the entropy of each set post-split, weighting it by the number of items in each split, then subtracting from the current entropy. If the result is positive, we've lowered entropy with our split. The higher the result is, the more we've lowered entropy.<br>\n",

This approach usually involves more complexity than it's worth and doesn't improve prediction accuracy, but it's worth knowing about.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the calculation of information gain and make splits simpler, we won't do it for each unique value. We'll find the median for the variable we're splitting on instead. Any rows where the value of the variable is below the median will go to the left branch, and the rest of the rows will go to the right branch. To compute information gain, we'll only have to compute entropies for two subsets.<br>\n",
