    "In traditional **object-oriented programming**, everything (yes, everything) is an object. Integers are objects, and so are Booleans. While Python isn't quite this object-oriented, objects are nonetheless abundant in the Python language. For example, the `math.floor` function is really just a **class method** for the `math` class. Class methods act on an entire class, rather than a particular instance of one. We often use them as utility functions.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice in the starter code that we've rewritten our `average_age()` method to use the `math` class, along with a list comprehension. This is somewhat advanced Python code, but you've seen all of it before. The `math.fsum` method acts on the `math` class, takes an iterable (i.e., a list or list-like) argument, and sums the values in the list to produce a result.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice also that we've begun writing a class method for you. The `@classmethod` line that appears above it tells the Python interpreter that the method is a class method. You'll need to follow this pattern whenever you declare class methods."
