    "We mentioned earlier that small integers can fit in one byte, and strings occupy one byte per character. This is true in **low-level** languages, which provide very little abstraction from a computer's architecture. Low-level languages like C often interact with portions of memory explicitly, and therefore have data types with very predictable memory usage. In C, a string with `10` characters will use `10` bytes of memory, and we can specify how many bytes we'd like to allocate to a given variable.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-level** languages like Python are more **expressive** than low-level languages. This means that they empower us to express logic quickly and easily. This ease comes at a cost, though; Python's internal representations of data types are less compact than those of a low-level language. Specifically, it really stores strings and integers as instances of the `str` and `int` classes, respectively. Instances of these classes are less predictable in terms of memory usage, but we can still study them to make deductions about memory.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Low-level languages are good for tasks where precise memory management and machine-level optimization are important. High-level languages are better for tasks the don't require intense optimization or a lot of overhead to get things done. For most tasks where memory efficiency isn't a big concern, using high-level languages will maximize the developer's productivity. To see the difference language choice can make, we'll look at some code that takes in a string, and then reverses it.<br>\n",

You can think of it as having many fingers (program counters) and reading many words (instructions) in a book (memory) at the same time. In the next mission, we'll explore the advantages and challenges that come with being able to execute multiple instructions at the same time."
