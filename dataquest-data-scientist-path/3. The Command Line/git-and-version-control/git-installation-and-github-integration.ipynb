    "In the last mission, we explored the basics of Git version control. In this project, we'll walk you through the process of setting Git up on your own machine and authenticating with GitHub. Afterwards, you'll be able to sync the changes you make to data science projects locally with GitHub. Finally, when you're ready, you can publish your code to GitHub and build a portfolio of projects for others to see.<br>\n",

If you encounter an error during the installation process, use Google and StackOverflow to attempt to debug and fix the issue. If you're still having difficulty, post about the issue you're experiencing in the [project forum](https://www.dataquest.io/forum/mission/204/project-git-installation-and-github-integration).\n",
