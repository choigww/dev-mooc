What if the folder had 100 files, you modified 10 of them, and your coworker modified 30 at the same time? You don't want to lose your changes every time your coworker uploads his version of the folder. Now, imagine that instead of just you and a coworker, it's a project with 10 or 100 contributors.<br>\n",

Similar to the way tree branches diverge from the trunk, Git branches allow us to create several different work areas within the same repo.

While the team will eventually want to merge all of the branches into master, using branches allows them to make changes to the repo separately while avoiding conflicts.<br>\n",

    "### Finding Differences Across Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "**The typical Git workflow** looks like this:\n",
    "* Create a branch off of `master` with the name of your feature. Let's say `feature/better-algo`.\n",
    "* Make your changes on the branch and create commits.\n",
    "* Push the branch to the remote repo.\n",
    "* Ask others to review and evaluate your branch.\n",
    "* Merge the branch into `master` once everyone thinks it looks okay.\n",
    "* Delete the branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how most teams of developers work. In order to review a team member's changes, though, it's critical to be able to see the differences between the feature branch and `master`. We refer to these differences as \"the diff.\"<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use GitHub as our remote repo, [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) will show us the differences between branches in an attractive interface, and allow other developers to add comments.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're not using GitHub, we can type `git diff` on the command line to see the differences between branches. This command shows line-by-line changes to the code. If the changes are additions, Git will display them in green and prefix them with a plus sign (`+`). If they're deletions, Git will display them in red and prefix them with a minus sign (`-`). It shows new files as additions.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The order in which we specify the two branches as arguments to `git diff` influences whether Git sees the changes as additions or deletions. It's generally preferable to put the \"older\" branch first."

    "### Branch Naming Conventions\n",

    "Features tend to be commits that add functionality to a project, while fixes resolve bugs and other issues. Chores are things that end users won't necessarily notice, but help us reorganize the project or make the code more efficient. These naming conventions make it easier to organize branches, and figure out what each one does without having to look at the full diff."
