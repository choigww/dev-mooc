This results in something called a merge conflict, which is painful to fix, and something we'll talk about in the next mission.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, Git gives us **a few ways to avoid merge conflicts**. The best method involves using branches. Similar to the way tree branches diverge from the trunk, Git branches allow us to create several different work areas within the same repo. It's common to create a new branch whenever we want to make a change to a project, and then merge that branch back into the master branch when we're done.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "Each of them originally pulled the master branch, which has the commit `f34`. Then they created separate branches; Superman created `enchancement`, Rocky created `rocky`, and Sally created `shells`. They each made a commit on their own branch.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When each person pushes their branch to the remote, Git stores it separately so that it doesn't conflict with everyone else's changes. Afterwards, the remote will have the branches `master`, `enhancement`, `rocky`, and `shells`. While the team will eventually want to merge all of the branches into master, using branches allows them to make changes to the repo separately while avoiding conflicts.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also other benefits to using branches. Imagine that Sally wants to make `10` more commits before merging, and Rocky wants to make `2`. Working on different branches will make their software development process go much faster.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a branch with the [git branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch) command. For example, `git branch rocky` will create a branch called `rocky`.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, we can switch to the new branch using the [git checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout) command. To do this, we'd type `git checkout rocky`. Alternatively, we can create a shortcut by combining the two commands with `git checkout -b rocky`. \n",

    "In the example above, the branch `enhancement` has one commit more than master.

If we switch to the master branch, Git will alter the working directory to contain a file called `bot.py` that contains the code `print('1')`.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Switching between branches is very useful when we want to work on changes to a project that require different amounts of testing or development time. By putting them in separate branches, we can save the state of each addition, without them conflicting with each other.<br>\n",

    "### Deleting Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "It's helpful to think of a branch as a collection of commits. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![6](img/6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, both `master` and `enhancement` have `b53` as the latest commit. In fact, both branches have identical commits. This isn't necessarily bad, but it does mean that the original, separate branch is redundant -- it no longer contains any unique commits. It's typical to use a branch to develop a single feature, merge that branch into master, and then delete the branch.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete a branch once we've merged all of its commits into another branch, we use the `git branch -d` command. `git branch -d` requires us to specify the name of a branch when we call it. Git will completely remove the branch from our local repo. If a branch has unmerged commits inside it, Git will prevent it from being deleted, so its generally safe to delete branches we think are old or unnecessary.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Having too many branches can make the repo hard to use, so most software teams tend to delete branches once they've merged them. If we have many branches, for example, listing all of them can print hundreds or thousands of lines, making it hard to find the ones we want. It also makes cloning or updating the repo more difficult, because Git needs to download information on all of the branches."

    "* Make your changes on the branch and create commits.\n",
    "* Push the branch to the remote repo.\n",
    "* Ask others to review and evaluate your branch.\n",
    "* Merge the branch into `master` once everyone thinks it looks okay.\n",

It shows new files as additions.<br>\n",

    "When we merge a branch into another one, our changes can sometimes **conflict with other people's commits**. Let's say that you're working on a project with another developer named `Ninja Jane`. You both edit the same file on your own branches, then Jane pushes her branch to the remote and merges it into `master`:\n",

    "This chain of events results in the following situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](8.png)\n",

    "At this point, the commit history for each branch looks like this:\n",

    "---|---|---\n",

    "e34|e34|e34\n",
    "67f|67f|67f\n",
    "45g|45g|782\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you and Jane branched off of `master` at the same time and you both made one commit, the histories for the two branches are almost identical. However, the latest commit for `master` and `shuriken` is `45g`, and the latest commit for `superbot` is `782`.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When you try to merge `superbot` into master, Git will notice that `45g` and `782` both come immediately after `67f`, and both edit the same lines in the same files. Because both commits are based on 67f, they're equally valid, and this causes a merge conflict. Git can't overwrite the changes in `master` with the changes from `superbot` because it doesn't know which changes are the \"correct\" ones. Git is designed to preserve everyone's work, so it won't cause a loss of effort by intentionally overwriting one person's commit with another's.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not possible for Git to just layer the commits on top of each other, because `782` and `45g` both come immediately after commit `67f`. If Git layered the changes on top of each other and applied commit `782` from `superbot`, Jane's changes in commit `45g` would be overwritten and lost. If commit `782` in `superbot` came after commit `45g` in the Git history instead, there would be no conflict.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When Git can't merge commits automatically, it informs the user of a merge conflict and asks them to sort it out. Sorting out a merge conflict involves editing the code that conflicts to create the \"correct\" version. This way, the person who wrote the code is in charge of resolving the issue, and Git isn't intentionally overwriting anyone's changes."

To use them, we'd need to run the [git mergetool](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-mergetool) command, along with the `--tool` option flag to specify which graphical tool to use. We can pull up a full list of available tools by running `git mergetool --tool-help`.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "There are some files that change very often, and aren't particularly useful to a project. One example is the `.DS_Store` file OS X puts in directories. Another is the `.pyc` files that Python produces when it compiles source files. Neither of these are necessary for the project to work properly, but because they change rapidly, they can create merge conflicts and other problems.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "To do this, we create a file called `.gitignore`. Then, we add lines to it indicating which files Git should ignore when adding to the staging area and committing. These lines accept wildcard characters, so we can ignore all files that have a certain extension in a single line.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following lines in `.gitignore` instruct Git to ignore all files called `.DS_Store`, and all files ending with `.pyc`:\n",

    ".DS_Store\n",
    "*.pyc\n",

It will still track changes to existing files it's already added to a commit, however, and also continue adding them to new commits.<br>\n",

Git will still track changes to these files, and add them to future commits. This can be frustrating, especially when those files cause merge conflicts that require a lot of effort to resolve.<br>\n",
