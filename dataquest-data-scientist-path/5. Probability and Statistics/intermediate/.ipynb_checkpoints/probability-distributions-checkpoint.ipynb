    "In the last mission, we defined $p$ as the probability of an outcome occurring, and q as the probability of it not occurring, where $q=1−p$. These types of probabilites are known as binomial -- there are two values, which add to `1` collectively. There's a `100%` chance of one outcome or the other occurring.<br>\n",

    "Many commonly occurring events can be expressed in terms of binomial outcomes -- a coin flip, winning a football game, the stock market going up, and more.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we deal with binomial probabilities, we're often interested in the chance of a certain outcome happening in a sequence. We want to know what the chances are of our favorite football team winning 5 of its next 6 games, and the stock market going up in 4 of the next 6 days.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The same interest applies when we're analyzing data. Companies and researchers conduct experiments every day. These can range from testing whether changing the button color on your webpage increases conversion rate to seeing if a new drug increases patient recovery rate.<br>\n",

    "## Simplifying the computation\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct our distribution, we had to write our own custom function, and a decent amount of code. We can instead use the [binom.pmf](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.16.1/reference/generated/scipy.stats.binom.html) function from [SciPy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html) to do this faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a usage example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from scipy import linspace\n",
    "from scipy.stats import binom\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a range of numbers from 0 to 30, with 31 elements (each number has one entry).\n",
    "outcome_counts = linspace(0,30,31)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create the binomial probabilities, one for each entry in outcome_counts.\n",
    "dist = binom.pmf(outcome_counts,30,0.39)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pmf` function in SciPy is an implementation of the mathematical [probability mass function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function). The `pmf` will give us the probability of each `k` in our `outcome_counts` list occurring. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A binomial distribution only needs two parameters. A **parameter** is the statistical term for a number that summarizes data for the entire population. For a binomial distribution, the parameters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `N`, the total number of events,\n",
    "* `p`, the probability of the outcome we're interested in seeing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SciPy function `pmf` matches this and takes in the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `x`: the list of outcomes,\n",
    "* `n`: the total number of events,\n",
    "* `p`: the probability of the outcome we're interested in seeing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we only need two parameters to describe a distribution, it doesn't matter whether we want to know if it will be sunny `5` days out of `5`, or if `5` out of `5` coin flips will turn up heads. As long as the outcome that we care about has the same probability (p), and $N$ is the same, the binomial distribution will look the same."

    "## Probability distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate z-scores (the number of standard deviations away from the mean a probability is) fairly easily. These z-scores can then be used how we used z-scores earlier -- to find the percentage of values to the left and right of the value we're looking at.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this more concrete, say we had `16` days where we observed more than `5000` riders. Is this likely? Unlikely? Using a z-score, we can figure out exactly how common this event is.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because every normal distribution, as we learned in an earlier mission, has the same properties when it comes to what percentage of the data is within a certain number of standard deviations of the mean. You can look these up in a [standard normal table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_normal_table). About `68%` of the data is within `1` standard deviation of the mean, `95%` is within `2`, and `99%` is within `3`. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of a binomial probability distribution using the formulas from earlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$μ=N∗p$$\n",
    "$$σ=\\sqrt{N∗p∗q}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to figure out the number of standard deviations from the mean a value is, we just do:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{k−μ}{σ}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to find how many standard deviations from the mean 16 days is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{16 - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{16 - (30 * .39)}{\\sqrt{30*.39*.61}} = \\frac{4.3}{2.67} = 1.61$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us that 16 days is approximately **1.61 standard deviations above the mean**. In percentage form, this captures about `44.63%` of our data. If we also include **1.61 standard deviations below the mean(both sides of distribution)**, this'll include `89.26%` of our data.<br>\n",
