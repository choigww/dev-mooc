    "In the last screen, our calculated chi-squared value is greater than all the values in the distribution, so our p-value is `0`, indicating that our result is **statistically significant**. You may recall from the last mission that `.05` is the typical threshold for statistical significance, and anything below it is considered significant.<br>\n",

    "Now that we have a chi-squared sampling distribution, we can compare the chi-squared value we calculated for our data to it to see if our result is statistically significant. The chi-squared value we calculated was `3728.95`. The highest value in the chi-squared sampling distribution was about `12`. This means that **our chi-squared value is higher than `100%` of all the values in the sampling distribution, so we get a p-value of `0`**. This means that there is a `0%` chance that we could get such a result randomly.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This would indicate that we need to investigate our data collection techniques more closely to figure out why such a result occurred.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a chi-squared value has no sign (all chi-squared values are positive), it doesn't tell us anything about the direction of the statistical significance. If we had `10771` `Females`, and `21790` `Males`, or `10771` `Males`, and `21790` `Females`, we'd get the same chi-squared value. It's important to look at the data and see how the data is unbalanced after calculating a chi-squared value and getting a significant result."
