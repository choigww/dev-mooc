    "We covered a bit of probability in the last mission, but we'll go more into depth here and build a strong foundation. Before we do that, let's introduce our dataset. Our dataset contains information on flags of countries around the world. Each row is a country. Here are the relevant columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `name` -- name of the country\n",
    "* `landmass` -- which continent the country is in (1=N.America, 2=S.America, 3=Europe, 4=Africa, 4=Asia, 6=Oceania)\n",
    "* `area` -- country area, in thousands of square kilometers\n",
    "* `population` -- rounded to the nearest million\n",
    "* `bars` -- Number of vertical bars in the flag\n",
    "* `stripes` -- Number of horizontal stripes in the flag\n",
    "* `colors` -- Number of different colours in the flag\n",
    "* `red, green, blue, gold, white, black, orange` -- 0 if color absent, 1 if color present in the flag\n",
    "\n",
    "This data was collected from Collins Gem Guide to Flags. It was written in 1986, so some flag information may be out of date!"
