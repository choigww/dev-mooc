    "## Getting to Know the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guided project, we're going to learn how to:\n",
    "* Import data into SQLite\n",
    "* Design a normalized database schema\n",
    "* Create tables for our schema\n",
    "* Insert data into our schema\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with a file of [Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball) games from [Retrosheet](http://www.retrosheet.org/). Retrosheet compiles detailed statistics on baseball games from the 1800s through to today. The main file we will be working from `game_log.csv`, has been produced by combining 127 separate CSV files from retrosheet, and has been pre-cleaned to remove some inconsistencies. The game log has hundreds of data points on each game which we will normalize this data into several separate tables using SQL, providing a robust database of game-level statistics.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the main file, we have also included three 'helper' files, also sourced from Retrosheet:\n",
    "* park_codes.csv\n",
    "* person_codes.csv\n",
    "* team_codes.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "These three helper files in some cases contain extra data, but will also make things easier as they will form the basis for three of our normalized tables.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "An important first step when working with any new data is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA gets us familiar with the data and gives us a level of background knowledge that will help us throughout our project. The methods you use when performing EDA will depend on what you plan to do with the data. In our case, we're wanting to create a normalized database, so our focus should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Becoming familiar, at a high level, with the meaning of each column in each file.\n",
    "* Thinking about the relationships between columns within each file.\n",
    "* Thinking about the relationships between columns across different files.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have included a `game_log_fields.txt` file from Retrosheet which explains the fields included in our main file, which will be useful to assist our EDA. You can use `!cat game_log_fields.txt` in its own Jupyter cell to read the contents of the file.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you're not familiar with baseball some of this can seem overwhelming at first, however this presents a great opportunity.** \n",
    "\n",
    "### When you are working with data professionally, you'll often encounter data in an industry you might be unfamiliar with - it might be digital marketing, geological engineering or industrial machinery. \n",
    "\n",
    "In these instances, you'll have to perform research in order to understand the data you're working with.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Baseball is a great topic to practice these skills with. Because of the long history within baseball of the collection and analysis of statistics (most famously the [Sabermetrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics) featured in the movie [Moneyball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_%28film%29)), there is a wide range of online resources available to help you get answers to any questions you may have.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started exploring the data by using pandas to read and explore the data. Setting the following options after you import pandas is recommendedâ€“ they will prevent the DataFrame output from being truncated, given the size of the main game log file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pd.set_option('max_columns', 180)\n",
    "pd.set_option('max_rows', 200000)\n",
    "pd.set_option('max_colwidth', 5000)\n",

    "* `id`: Each game begins with a **twelve character ID record** which identifies the `date`, `home team`, and `number of the game`. For example, `ATL198304080` should be read as follows. \n",
    "  * The first three characters identify the home team (the Braves). \n",
    "  * The next four are the year (1983). \n",
    "  * The next two are the month (April) using the standard numeric notation, 04, followed by the day (08). \n",
    "  * The last digit indicates if this is a single game (`0`), first game (`1`) or second game (`2`) if more than one game is played during a day, usually a double header The id record starts the description of a game thus ending the description of the preceding game in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might notice that this essentially makes a custom key using the three columns we identified in our composite key example earlier. After we import the data, we'll construct this column to use as a primary key in our final database.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next task is to import the data into SQLite. There are **three key ways to import data into a SQLite database**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Using the Python SQLite library\n",
    "The [Python SQLite library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) gives us ultimate control when importing data. We will first need to get the data into Python - we might choose to use the [csv module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) for this. Next, we would use the [`Cursor.execute()` method] (https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.execute) to create a table for our data.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we can use the [`Cursor.executemany()` method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.executemany) to insert multiple rows of data in a single command. If we create our [connection object](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#connection-objects) with a filename that doesn't exist, the sqlite module will create the database file for us.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We should take advantage of the `?` placeholder value syntax instead of using [python string formatting](https://pyformat.info/) **to prevent [SQL injection attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection#Incorrect_type_handling)** (like the hilarious [XKCD 'Bobby Tables' comic example](https://xkcd.com/327/)) and maintain the correct data types. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Even though in this project we won't be running any external user code, this is an extremely good habit to get into. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what our syntax would look like for the last step:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list_of_lists = [\n",
    "    [4, 4, 8, 2],\n",
    "    [5, 1, 6, 3],\n",
    "    [5, 2, 4, 6]\n",
    "]\n",
    "c = \"\"\"\n",
    "INSERT INTO table_name (\n",
    "    column_one,\n",
    "    column_two,\n",
    "    [...]\n",
    ") VALUES (\n",
    "    ?,\n",
    "    ?\n",
    "    [...]\n",
    ");\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "cur.executemany(c, my_list_of_lists)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this method is that we have the highest level of control over what we're doing. Additionally, if we have larger data, we can write a loop that iterates over our source line by line so that we don't have to read all of it into memory at once.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**The disadvantage is that there is a lot of manual data handling required**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Using pandas\n",
    "The pandas library includes a handy [`DataFrame.to_sql()` method](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_sql.html) that we can use to send the contents of a dataframe to a SQLite connection object. We can either create the table first using the method above, or if the table does not exist, pandas will create it for us. Here's an example of what that looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dataframe.to_csv('table_name', sqlite_connection_object, index=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Most of the time, we'll want to use index=False, otherwise pandas will create an extra column for the pandas index.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this method is that **it can often be done with a line or two of code**.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage is that pandas **may alter the data as it reads it in and converts the columns to types automatically**. Additionally, this **requires the data to be small enough to be able to be stored in-memory** using pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. From the SQLite shell\n",
    "The last method is to use the SQLite shell to import the data. Like the pandas method, we can either create the table manually ourselves, or rely on SQLite to do it for us. Here's the commands you would use to import a CSV using the SQLite shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sqlite> .mode csv\n",
    "sqlite> .import filename.csv table_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### This is one of the quickest methods to use and works well with large data sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several **minor inconveniences** to this method. \n",
    "* SQLite **detects the column types using the first row of data**, which can lead to incorrect types.\n",
    "* You'll need **SQLite shell access**, which you won't always have.\n",
    "* Lastly, if you want to create the table yourself, you will **need to remove the header from the first line** of your CSV, otherwise SQLite will make that the first row of your table.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of these methods, unless we explicitly create the table, **the table will be created with no primary key**. For now this isn't a problem as we'll be migrating this data into new, normalized tables.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the pandas method in this instance, because we've already read the data into dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The type conversion isn't a big issueâ€“ \n",
    "as outlined above we will move the data into new tables and can handle type conversion then.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hint: \n",
    "Just like in the previous guided project, our database retains 'state', so if we run a query that creates or modifies a table twice, the query will fail. [Some commands like `CREATE TABLE`](https://sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html) support `IF NOT EXISTS` which will allow you to run your notebook without these errors. You should consult the [SQLite documentation](https://sqlite.org/lang.html) for the availability and syntax of these clauses."

    "## Planning a Normalized Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've started to think about normalization ideas, it's time to start planning our schema. The best way to work visually with a schema diagram, just like the ones we've used so far in this course. Start by creating a diagram of the four existing tables and their columns, and then gradually create new tables that move the data into a more normalized state.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people like to do this on paper, others use diagramming tools like Sketch or Figma, others like using Photoshop or similar. Our recommendation is that the best way to do this is using a schema designing tool like [DbDesigner.net](https://dbdesigner.net/). This free tool allows you to create a schema and will create lines to show foreign key relations clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "![dbdesigner](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/193/dbdesigner-screenshot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, you should choose the tool that you feel like you will be able to work quickly in as you plan out your schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some tips when planning out your schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Don't be afraid to experiment**. It's unlikely that your first few steps will be there in your finished product - try things and see how they look.\n",
    "* If you're using a tool like DbDesigner which automatically shows lines for foreign key relationships, don't worry if your lines look messy. This is normalâ€“ you can move the tables around to neaten things up at the end, but don't waste time on it while you are still normalizing.\n",
    "* The following facts about the data may help you with your normalization decisions:\n",
    "  * **Historically, teams sometimes move between leagues.**\n",
    "  * **The same person might be in a single game as both a player and a manager**\n",
    "  * **Because of how pitchers are represented in the game log, not all pitchers used in a game will be shown. We only want to worry about the pitchers mentioned via position or the 'winning pitcher'/ 'losing pitcher'.**\n",
    "* It is possible to over-normalize. We want to **finish with about 7-8 tables total**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we advise spending between 60-90 minutes on your planning your schema. In the next step, we will introduce our suggested schema that we will work with for the rest of the project, but working as much of it out yourself is highly recommended."
