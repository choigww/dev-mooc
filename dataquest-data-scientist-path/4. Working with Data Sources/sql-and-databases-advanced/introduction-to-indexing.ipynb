    "Instead of creating a separate table and updating it ourselves, **we can specify a column we want an index table for and SQLite will take care of the rest**. SQLite, and most databases, make it easy for you to create indexes for tables on columns we plan to query often. To create an index we use the [`CREATE INDEX` statement](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createindex.html). Here's the psuedo-code for that statement:\n",

Similar to when you add a table to a database, using the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause helps you avoid attempting to create an index that already exists. Doing so will cause SQLite to throw an error. To create an index for the `area` column called `area_idx`, we write the following query:\n",

As our queries become more complex, letting SQLite decide how and when to use the indexes we create helps us be much more productive. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we create an index for the `area` column in the `facts` table, **SQLite will use the index whenever we search for rows in `facts` using that column**. This index would be similar to the one we worked with in the past step and each row would only contain the area value and the corresponding row's id value. The index would be ordered by the area values for quick lookups.\n",

    "SELECT * FROM facts WHERE area < 10000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the `area_idx` index would be ordered by the `area` values, SQLite would:\n",
    "\n",
    "* search for the first instance in the index where area equaled 10000 and store the id value in a temporary collection.\n",
    "* it would then advance to the next row in the index to check if the WHERE condition was still met.\n",
    "  * if not, then the temporary collection would be returned and the process completes.\n",

A table can have many indexes, and most tables in production environments usually do have many indexes. Every time you add or delete a row to the table, all of the indexes will be updated. If you edit the values in a row, SQLite will figure out which indexes are affected by the changes and update those indexes. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "While creating indexes gives us tremendous speed benefits, they come at the cost of space. Each index needs to be stored in the database file. In addition, adding, editing, and deleting rows takes longer since each of the affected indexes need to be updated. Since indexes can be created after a table is created, it's recommended to only create an index when you find yourself querying on a specific column frequently. Throughout the rest of the course, we'll explore how to understand the tradeoffs and you'll develop a better sense of how to create indexes in an optimal way."
