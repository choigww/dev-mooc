plot : two teen couples go to a church party drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life and has nightmares . what's the deal ? watch the movie and " sorta " find out . . . critique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write since i generally applaud films which attempt,-1
the happy bastard's quick movie review damn that y2k bug . it's got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . little do they know the power within . . . going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there virus still feels very empty like a movie going for a,-1
it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch . based on the late 1960's television show by the same name the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover . however things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion . of course the ads make it seem like so much more . quick cuts cool music claire dane's nice hair and cute outfits car,-1
 " quest for camelot " is warner bros . ' first feature-length fully-animated attempt to steal clout from disney's cartoon empire but the mouse has no reason to be worried . the only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall's promising if flawed 20th century fox production " anastasia " but disney's " hercules " with its lively cast and colorful palate had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997's best piece of animation . this year it's no contest as,-1
synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy's mother a fledgling restauranteur . unsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman's favor he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . comments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry both theatrical and di,-1
capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace . there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise . john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films especially assault on precinct 13 that the new film comes off as his homage to himself . 0 ( -4 to +4 ) . john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes . for a writer and ,-1
so ask yourself what " 8mm " ( " eight millimeter " ) is really all about . is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ? is it about the business itself how bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana there's a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won't necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? or is it about those w,-1
that's exactly how long the movie felt to me . there weren't even nine laughs in nine months . it's a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man mr . hugh grant a huge dork . it's not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant not me ) that bugs me it's the fact that grant is annoying . not just adam sandler-annoying we're talking jim carrey-annoying . since when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting ? but on the other hand since w,-1
call it a road trip for the walking wounded . stellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it's difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly boozed-out presence . yet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets unable to ex,-1
best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann's forensics thriller manhunter scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on . usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do . if you want to see some brilliant acting check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdor,-1
janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker . this is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs . it also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there too . garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection . denis leary plays the s,-1
a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . first there's the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . but occasionaly almost as if making an ironic self-depreciating remark the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . no no . . . just kidding . had you going there for a moment didn't i ? in all seriousness however and to be fair to the movie it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a m,-1
i'm really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . sure she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god's green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in she always strikes out . the crush was a slow-moving predictable piece of fluff . hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . clueless was an annoying unfunny waste of time . and people have e-mailed me too saying clueles,-1
so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind 2001 : a space odyssey apollo 13 and contact ? well whatever it is you'd sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange considering the disastrous results we're left with here . this is a film that takes a little bit of everything but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! it's like i said . ,-1
the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film's end . if you're not familiar with this law then maybe you've seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film's end . now if you're a regular reader of mine you've heard me say this countless times : you know how drive me crazy is going to end but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ? no it definitely is not . melissa joan hart ( from abc's " ,-1
mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla . his entrance however is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps gargantuan and imposing sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have . joe bellows at the poachers before him angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars . during this scene i turned to my fr,-1
 " spawn " features good guys bad guys lots of fighting bloody violence a leather-clad machine gun chick gooey self-healing bullet holes scatological humor and a man-eating monster . it not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12- and 13-year-old boys it appears to have been made by them . in a classic example of telling and not showing " spawn " opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness forces of light and how " men are the ones who cre,-1
 " in dreams " might keep you awake at night but not because of its creepy imagery bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths . no the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie's brutally squandered potential the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by tired serial killer genre standards . the big letdown however comes upon the realization that this 100-minute head-scratcher was mastermi,-1
 " knock off " is exactly that : a cheap knock off of an action movie . it's also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year . i figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 but alas it has already been found . jean-claude van damme stars as ( i think ) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods . rob schneider plays van damme's partner and rochon plays . . . actually i have no idea w,-1

one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film . after all he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave . he is also an esteemed film critic lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing . however his latest creation in praise of love is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year . the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit to dissect love into the followin,-1
america loves convenience . after all we're the culture that invented the cell phone the 24-hour atm and my most beloved the remote control . yet perhaps this time with ghosts of mars we have taken our love of convenience to far . ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails pill-poppin' martian cop sent with her squadron to retrieve " demolition " williams ( ice cube ) from a remote mining town for trial back home . when she and her comrades appropriately ,-1
reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others each derivative in their own special way ) . the guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : " rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel " ) create multi-faceted characters or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story incre,-1
one-sided " doom and gloom " documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible . orson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he along with best-selling author hal lindsey discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent ( well for 1976 anyway ) events . the film is dated badly as many things that are supposed to happen in the " future " never do . for example the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up ,-1
play it to the bone the newest addition to ron shelton's sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways . like most of shelton's other great films ( bull durham white men can't jump ) this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots . shelton's films are not considered sports films but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story . shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to anal,-1
hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell . the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films . in a nutshell the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous . with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership a lot of hong kong's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . producti,-1
if you're into watching near on two hours of bored foul-mouthed florida teens having sex doing drugs having sex listening to eminem having sex playing video games having sex and killing one of their peers then " bully " 's for you . based on jim schutze's novelization of a true-life event " bully " charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who in 1993 murdered their high school bully in cold calculated blood . the film could have provided fascinating ins,-1
sean connery stars as a harvard law professor who heads back into the courtroom by way of the everglades to defend a young educated black man ( blair underwood ) . the guy is on death row for the murder of a white girl and says that his confession was coerced from the region's tough black cop ( lawrence fishburne ) . watching connery and fishburne bump heads for two hours is amusing enough but the plot's a joke . there's no logic at work here . tone is also an issue--there is non,-1
among multitude of erotic thrillers that had been released in the early 1990s woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty star of the b-grade action films of the previous decade . those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star . as director ginty did very little to improve that impression . the protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) yacht skipper that falls mad,-1
 " lake placid " marks yet another entry in the series of " predator pics " that were a screen staple in the late 1970s ( post- " jaws " ) and were revived recently by the godawful " anaconda . " " placid " claims to be a " horror/comedy " -it's directed by the same guy who did " house " -but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of " anaconda .

capsule : where are you tonight leni rienfenstal ? starship troopers is an expensive hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography -- and bad pornography at that . it is not good cinema not good storytelling and not even stupid fun : it's so cynically calculatedly bone-headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed . it's one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time . why am i calling this movie pornography ?,-1
the classic story & the production which ruined it marking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h . g . wells classic new line cinema armed with a stellar cast and expert make-up effects man stan winston ( alien predator terminator etc ) churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel . of course the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 under the title the isl,-1
a pseudo-intellectual film about the pseudo-intellectual world of art magazines high art is as wasted as its drug-addled protagonists . in the only notable part of the movie ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles not that lisa cholodenko's script or direction makes you care much about either character . living in a world of heroin induced highs they float along until they fall in love with each other . this uninviting picture full of preten,-1
 " party camp " is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i've seen in awhile . a late rip-off of the " meatballs " series the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk . that's really about all that can be said about the " plot " because nothing much happens except that the main character wise-cracking jerry ( andrew ross ) has the hots for a cute blonde ( kerry brennan ) and there is a big contest in the climax . how fun ! since " party camp ",-1

when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy i expect negative reviews from critics left and right . predictable unoriginal and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you's and the drive me crazy's released by the dozens these last couple of years . what i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while i'm sitting in the theater . am i enjoying myself ? is this a comfortable break from my week of finals ? this is why i,-1
all through its production and into the early days of its initial aborted pre-release publicity hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . ultimately however paramount pictures nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996's other underperforming disaster films ( dante's peak volcano ) changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . but to paraphrase the bard swill by any other name would smell as rank . no number of name changes can ,-1
instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as " powerful " or " touching " . i have a name for it myself : " gross " . this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully the bully looks at the " rebel " threateningly about to hurt him and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too . how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren't present day moviegoers beyond being " inspired " b,-1

talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters ! spice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band the spice girls . it's intended as a sort of hard day's night but ends up simply hard to watch . when watching the spice girls i'm reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs the snorks or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one person,-1
one of the responses those that enjoy " detroit rock city " ( probably kiss fans mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i've given the film might be something like : " oh that casey's gone and become a jaded critic on us . just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like this ?

funny how your expectations can be defeated and not in good ways . the ghost and the darkness promised ( at least it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature . what it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material -- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters .

movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good the bad and the despicable . i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in '95 but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics . we need to be warned about some truly awful films too . this picture was so bad it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below ) . the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is ,-1

 " first rule of fight club is don't talk about fight club .

there's a 1 000-foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact . i'd say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies which are getting more irwin allen- esque with every release . the early wave of this revival while just as cheesy and laughable at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes . deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps ,-1
 " there will be another " the ads for this sequel proclaimed and why not ? true brandon lee is dead but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994's the crow anyway . the idea of spinning artist james o'barr's original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie taking its own righteous vengeance against the world . given that basic framework the story could,-1

tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . the film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage and while it's evident that this could be a fascinating live production the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performanc,-1

capsule : the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension . alien 3 ( the " 3 " should be in superscript ) is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen . it continues the story of ripley the space-trucker-turned-impromptu-survivalist but seems remarkably uninterested in her . in fact the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all it's so elegaic and limp . a little,-1

numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi suspense thrillers . soldier is a multi ? crossbreed between the likes of terminator aliens and offspring . the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel ? not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground . besides this the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age . the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt rus,-1

another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles much like " waking ned devine " and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town such as tolerant vicars and policemen plenty of eccentrics and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . the strength of this film lies in its rational theme that smoking pot should be legalized since it is eve,-1

warning : spoilers are included in this review . . . but it doesn't really make much of a difference . deep impact begins the official summer movie season and it also brings back memories of 1997 . remember when dante's peak came out in february ? a few months later volcano was released . the first film was smart exhilirating and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen . the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent . well it's deja vu all ove,-1

ever since wargames the first real computer hacking movie hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking . these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous . if it's not this the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect . hackers is guilty of all of these crimes . to anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that y,-1
if there's one thing i just can't stand it's a film that oozes with sentimentality . here's a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves . swelling saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy and that the situation is hopeless . alas my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are othe,-1
this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash . this is more about a parable of greed and how money can become the bane of your life . yes there are elements of ? fargo' here ( the snow and cold ) although not as vivid in the blood and gore department . it shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives . and how at the end of the day the things that matter most are love truth and honesty . a,-1

 " practical magic " is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high-profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap-trap like this one . the film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches spanning back 200 years . at the start their parents die when they are still children and they go to live with their two zany aunts ( stockard channin,-1
nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre -- " frankenweenie " " beetlejuice " " batman " " edward scissorhands " " ed wood " " mars attacks !

note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species . squandering an intriguing premise the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season des,-1
the sequel to the fugitive ( 1993 ) u . s marshals is an average thriller using it's association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks . tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive . this time he's after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents but of course he's been set up and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes he m,-1
one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o'donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton's 1925 silent film seven chances . now i've never seen seven chances as i'm more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this . o'donnell plays jimmie shannon the manager of a pool table manufacturing company . he also fears commitment and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three yea,-1

apparantly money talks . . . and uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so ! i've always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity a film can possess whether in language violence sex or what have you . i find that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movie goes overboard and money talks definitely does ! it's not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly ( and i mean constantly ! ) but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way,-1
starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public--particularly kids-- wanted to see . therefore it's with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas . despite some innovation and risk taking the story is surprisingly straightforward an,-1

susan granger's review of " ghosts of mars " ( sony pictures entertainment ) horror auteur john carpenter ( " halloween " " vampires " ) strikes out with this sci-fi eco-fable that's so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got green-lit . the script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last year's " pitch black " involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves ,-1
plot : based on the wildly popular " jerry springer " tv show this movie follows the lives of two groups of people before they make their bizarre appearances on the infamous program . one posse comes from the trailer parks and are to be featured in the " i slept with my stepfather " segment and the other is based on some fly-girl whose girlfriends keep sleeping with her undevoted " dog " boyfriend . critique : the truth is that if i didn't have a day job i would probably watch the real ",-1
i never understood what the clich ?

here's a concept -- jean-claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie . now if that isn't enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie i don't know what is . all sarcasm aside it is certainly a different way to start a movie of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother -- so lucky us we get to see more of jean-claude . van damme #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their ope,-1
what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project . most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films . john frankenheimer who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60's recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directoria,-1

the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could've been effective . such is the case with _urban legend_ the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks . the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends . examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house . the killer wears one of those l . l . bean parkas wit,-1
my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love . i love ralph fiennes . i love uma thurman . i love sean connery . hell i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw . i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since . a few months into the summer however i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground . th,-1

dead-bang an action thriller starring don johnson lives up to its dumb title or at least to half of it . although dead-bang is definitely dead it is anything but a bang ; in fact they should have called this one " dead bore .

i have no real tangible proof of this but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director then it is actually possible to make a good movie . using their logic all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget . this is the only way i can fathom,-1
jean-claude van damme movies tend to be if nothing else a lot of mindless fun . his latest film " knock off " skips on the fun part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise that is well simply mindless . you can't really blame van damme . no one i suspect has ever expected " the muscles from brussels " to contribute a heartfelt performance brimming with introspection and delicate shades of gray . and even his sidekick co-star " saturday night live " alumnus rob " makin' copies ,-1
there was probably a good reason that the warner bros . studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened . and after seeing this piece of toxic waste i now know why . this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago . fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god's country somewhere in eastern kentucky . it's beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an un,-1
tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers all searching for deeper meaning . however they won't find much meaning in the real blonde and not enough real humor either . joe ( matthew modine ) is a struggling actor or he claims to be one even though he has no credits under his belt . his girlfriend mary ( catherine keener ) has no pretensions about her career : she's a makeup artist working for the eccentric fashion photographer ,-1
the ads for " batman and robin " scream " the event of the summer is here " and that's the problem . the producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it . " batman and robin " is 126 minutes of lavish sets flashy costumes and big confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance . it's like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright busy and visually diverting but not very much fun . it wasn't always th,-1
 " gordy " is not a movie it is a 90-minute-long " sesame street " skit and a very bad one at that . this movie is so stupid and dumb that it's depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie . i'm sure children are the target audience of this movie but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it . it is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy ( voiced by garms ) wh,-1
senseless ( r ) marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life . alas moments are simply that moments which are not enough to lift this fantasy/comedy above its one-joke premise . granted that one joke is initially amusing . when wayans's darryl witherspoon an economics major at stratford university hits some dire financial straits he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses . aft,-1
a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent but one with no edge to it . it turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich ? s and stock characters of this genre . though it's a well-written and well-acted fluff piece it still does not have too much to say that is surprising . it's made for the gentle art-house set those who don't want something too disturbing to think about . it's about a critically successful writer husband alec ( pryce ) who is so self-absorbe,-1
if you're the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn ( butter optional ) then this is the movie for you ! indeed this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative rip-offs of other recent action movies or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them . it's difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film . but at least we're warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase giving us an oppo,-1

 " desperate measures " is a generic title for a film that's beyond generic . it's also a depressing waste of talent with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles not to mention once-cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not-cool flicks -- this thriller is more " before and after " than " reversal of fortune . " the movie is a big disappointment and yet it's somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to atta,-1

ever watch a very young child try and tell a joke that is beyond his or her sophistication ? it's full of stops and starts and usually the punch line is ruined . i felt the same way watching drowning mona . skip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy . there are some slightly successful attempts at humor but they only serve as window dressing . there is a running gag about the town verplanck n . y . being a test town for the th,-1
so it's thirty years later and oscar and felix are together again . that might have been an exciting notion if it wasn't for the fact that the " odd couple " of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993's " grumpy old men " 1995's " grumpier old men " and 1997's " out to sea " ( i . e .

mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival . as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival . it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time . in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry . toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart . the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but wri,-1

watching the movie i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup cute 'n cuddly computer-generated monkey . if the monkey died the movie got an extra half star . alas the monkey showed up at the end unharmed to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs . what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars . that's pretty generous considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek . when ,-1

starring ben stiller elizabeth hurley maria bello janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz permanent midnight is a pretty bad movie though it took me a few days to conclude this . the film is more masturbatory than bleak with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity .

gun wielding arnold schwarzenegger has a change of heart by the film's end and becomes a believer in god instead of a skeptic going through an amazing transformation by having a christian epiphany in the final scene as he becomes someone who can now beat the devil by his faith alone . . . this is after two hours of throwing people out windows and shooting more people than your average serial killer . nobody can save this bomb from it's own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance i,-1

one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek the star of the wb's runaway hit dawson's creek . following in the foot steps of mtv's two other live action films joe's apartment ( 1996 ) and dead man on campus ( 1998 ) varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace . set in west cannan texas the film examines the small town obsession with high school football th,-1
susan granger's review of " jeepers creepers " ( mgm/ua entertainment ) this nasty little horror film begins as a bickering brother ( justin long ) and sister ( gina philips ) are driving through the desolate countryside on their way home from college and spy a man dropping wrapped-up bodies down a drainage pipe . when long decides to investigate there's nothing but trouble . " you know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it ?,-1
come on hollywood surprise me . stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset . the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls . personal because his niece is one of the victims . it's a slobbering psychopath of course but this time there's a twist . freeman notes that each of the young women who've disappeared are all strong willed,-1
i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part 3 . the best way i can put it is that it's funky . i know this is an odd question but remember the opening music of " police academy 4 : citizens on patrol " when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song " citizens on patrol " during the opening credits ? it's just like that . anyway part 3 takes place a day after the events of part 2 ( so technically still 1985 ) . this time a group of horny teens ( who ,-1
jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today . from time-to-time she blows away audiences with powerful intense performances . on the other hand this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis' king kong . and much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it if only in quality . hush is o,-1
synopsis : sonny koufax ( adam sandler ) is a rich childish angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa ( kristy swanson ) . in a bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin ( jon stewart ) and adopts a 5 year old boy named julian ( cole and dylan sprouse ) while kevin is on an overseas trip . under sonny's supervision julian soon learns to lie to women tell people how he " wipes his ass " throw tantrums and scream for his " god damned " treats . self,-1
certainly no one would rent ed wood's glen or glenda ? expecting to see a good movie but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn't know was possible . in fact wood's infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison . watching glen or glenda ? i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together ; as a result it is actually quite enterta,-1
the second serial-killer thriller of the month is just awful . oh it starts deceptively okay with a handful of intriguing characters and some solid location work . after a baby-sitter gets gutted in the suit- ably spooky someone's-in-the-house prologue parallel stories unfold the first involving a texas sheriff ( r . lee emery ) a gruesome double murder and the arrival of a morose fbi agent ( dennis quaid ) on the eve of voting for the local lawman's reelection . the second pairs ,-1
this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup and i kind of feel like i have to say something negative about this film . no one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical story . however even if one thinks of it as fiction " the prince of egypt " remains shallow . but i'll begin from the beginning . the biggest difference between the original biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the ,-1
for " original sin " the road to the screen has been rocky . initially slated for release last november the film was bumped twice finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001 . advance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands . so is " original sin " really all that bad ? yes it is but the melodrama does offer some rewards . the location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling ,-1
one would think that david duchovny star of the cult favorite " x-files " would be very careful in choosing his leading man cinema roles . at least one would hope so . one would be seriously incorrect . eugene sands ( duchovny ) is a surgeon so dedicated to his craft that he becomes addicted to amphetamines to stay awake and work more . it turns out to be a bad plan when he loses a patient and his license while under the influence . ten months later in a seedy bar to score synthetic her,-1

as far as " mystery men " is concerned the burning question is less " is it really as bad as it looks from the trailer ? " ( the answer there is an unequivocal " yes " ) and more " how in the name of sweet jesus did first-time director kinka usher get such a first-rate cast to act in this muck ? " " mystery men " features greg kinnear as the heavily-sponsored captain amazing and geoffrey rush as his arch nemesis ( singular ) casanova frankenstein . a veritable police lineup of hot hollywo,-1

 " american pie " alums jason biggs and mena suvari star in this summer's attempt to capitalize on the youth market looking for a comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute couple-ness and zany comedy . it's about an a+ student ( biggs as " paul " ) who gets a scholarship to some college in new york city who sticks out like a sore thumb and falls for dora ( suvari ) a ditzy heroin-chic goth chick who has no ambition or self-respect whatsoever and allows he,-1
last summer a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning . based on the famous 60's television show the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later the studio is up to their old tricks again with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild wild west . but it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld who both contribute,-1
plot : token director alan smithee steals the only copy of his film " trio " from the studio after they complete the " final cut " without him . he threatens to burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep his vision . critique : wow . i really can't remember the last time a movie sucked on so many levels ! the " comedy " in this film is pathetic obvious and dated ( oj simpson jokes galore ) . the plot is uninteresting boring and bad . the structure of the film is annoying r,-1
not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie . earlier this year nora ephron wrote and produced one of the year's least likeable " comedies " called hanging up featuring a bunch of annoying women ( ironically lisa kudrow played one in that film as well ) who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves . ick . . . real sweet stuff . but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer with a ,-1
the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars . producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze . gone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry . cage is legendary retired car thief memphis raines ( don't ,-1
it's amazing how a comedian can have the some of the funniest stand-up around but completely fall flat in the movies . take adam sandler . on the basis of his first two cds ( " they're all gonna laugh at you ! " and " what the hell happened to me ? " ) he's the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams . but when you put him in front of a camera it just isn't the same . i kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted a marginal recommendation but his latest film t,-1
according to popular film opinion a film's greatness is determined by time . take for example " casablanca . " great film even today . it's still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic . another example would be " star wars " which had a very very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before . but as i rewatched " independence day " when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 i ,-1
shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen . it is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies . that is however not to say it is a good film a quality production or anything of the sort . shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work . the finest sign of ,-1
working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front-line african american actress like jada pinkett smith . despite being one of the freshest talents available pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts ( a low down dirty shame the nutty professor ) . the problem is of course that there aren't many good roles available for black women . take away the likes of waiting to exhale set it off soul food and eve',-1
first troy beyer wrote the critically panned " b . a . p . s . " now she makes her directorial debut writing directing and starring in this sub-par film about women talking about sex . though not without redeeming qualities this film is bad . the basic story follows three single friends -- jazz ( beyer ) lena ( randi ingerman ) and michelle ( paget brewster ) -- in their search for love . jazz has an idea for a local talk show ; it would feature women talking about sex and dating,-1
susan granger's review of " mulholland drive " ( universal focus ) whatever david lynch is selling i'm not buying . from the writer/director of " blue velvet " and " twin peaks " comes another dark mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills . dazed a beautiful brunette ( laura elena harring ) emerges and stumbles down a hill slipping unobserved into a '30s-style apartment as the tenant ,-1
the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending . watching one of these movies everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise . when the film ends there is a moment of confusion then recollection then some more confusion then possibly a second viewing for clarification . this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more . good surprises make movies fun to watch . then,-1
 " spice world " is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls . sure there's a hint of humor in there every once in a while . actually there's a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls . but overall who cares ? not me . if you don't know by now the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood . in " spice world " they ride around in their big t,-1
as bad as " mimic " was it definitly scared me . " mimic " continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity and style and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie . director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film " cronos . " that movie worked because it took an unconventional story unique characters and well written plot and dialogu,-1
vampire's is a rude chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as pawns of abuse present only to pleasure men feed vampires readied to be bashed or beaten - till one's sensibilities is shocked by the low iq and mentality of this regressive movie . to make matters worse the buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks and deserve to have their heads bitten off if not their bodies carved in half . the dilemma of hating the ? heroes' as much as the ? villains' makes one ,-1
let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years . i am not too fond of ted turner's world championship wrestling however and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight . the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs ( david arquette aptly cast as a neandrathal ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everyt,-1

hey i've got a great idea for a movie ! ok here it is : we'll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so ! what's that ? sounds too boring ? ok how about this then : we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours but half of them are angry looks and half of them are " i'm in pain !

the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie ( if you don't count neil simon's biloxi blues ) . year after year more predictably cliched military movies come out -- most recently sgt . bilko -- and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last . i thought stripes would be different . with ivan reitman as director bill murray as star and harold ramis as co-star and co-screenwriter it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army . instead ,-1
 " mercury rising " has numerous flaws but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . that's right . the major aspect of the film that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning and the movie would turn out exactly the same if not better . this central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic . his name is simon and an evil government bureaucra,-1
i have never been a " star trek " fan and to tell the truth out of the five films in the series that i have seen ( 1 2 3 8 9 ) i have disliked all of them . i do however always go into one of these with an open mind and the ninth film in the series " star trek : insurrection " is no exception . dropping almost completely the hard-core sci-fi element of the previous one in the series " first contact " " insurrection " tells the story of a planet that holds only 6,-1
i suppose it's unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it's 1991 release . michael lehmann's action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time' or close thereof . the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk who's just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation ( `let me put it this way ' he explains `i never saw et' ) . greeting him is his old fr,-1
if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film it was studio 54 the late steve rubell's infamous new york discotheque which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era's heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone all set to a thumping dance beat . so when miramax started production on _54_ last year the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself written and directed by a promising ,-1

the spy game is up . you can thank charlie's angels -- the movie -- for that . when did banality and pandering become okay ? just steal from hong kong the matrix and a kitschy tv show from the mid-1970s and that's a movie ? charlie's angels is one of the worst examples of action film homogeneity and shameless duplicity in any film i've seen in ages . charlie's angels is dumb . just plain dumb . as we all know three of the hottest females on the planet -- drew barrymore cameron dia,-1
as you should know this summer has been less than memorable . with a total of 4 decent films it's not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing . with that said you can pretty much predict what my opinion on " the 13th warrior " will be . the film is based on the michael crichton " eaters of the dead " in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king . after tarveling for many months he comes across a gang of norsemen who are ,-1
if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films i might say that i review movies that don't look particularly good because i'm doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it . if that were true i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : " shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don't have to .

for timing reasons having to do with baby sitters we recently went to a multiplex and saw undercover blues . i would give it one half of a star for guts . anyone in a movie this bad would have to have guts . i later read a ny times review that said kathleen turner and dennis quaid had gotten so plump they looked like they had the mumps in the show . the script was the worst part . they had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh . they had lots of " great,-1
the tagline for this film is : " some houses are just born bad " . so i didn't expect too much from this . but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre . i thought : liam neeson cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont . i thought mabe it will be fun ? and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing . but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones jan de bont ? . these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies a,-1
the main problem with martin lawrence's pet project a thin line between love and hate like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man is that his character is an irresponsible jerk and if that is the case it doesn't seem to do anything except justify the woman's actions . that is especially the case in lawrence's darnell wright . he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long . now don't think i condone this just because i'm male . my philosophy is,-1
the great actor james woods once said ( and i'm paraphrasing ) " if sex isn't messy then you're not doing it right " . a truly profound statement and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace " sex " with " your mad slasher film " ) . for those uninformed souls the mad slasher genre ( or sub-genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but always crazed killer stal,-1
the premise of turbulence is i'm sure very familiar to us all . we've seen it before in passenger 57 executive decision and countless other flicks that are good in there own way . you know terrorists take over a plane ask the police on the ground for what they what and so on . turbulence starts out with a " convict " ray liotta being accused of a crime . you think there is no way he could have done it he's so open and kind . he is taken in and is subsequently transported on a comm,-1
a movie laced with a good blend of action comedy and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way creating a dismal and unsatisfactory product . eighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed minus half of its original duo ( the late john belushi ) and nearly all of its original charm . dan aykroyd reprises his role ( as well as his co-writ,-1
if only austin powers : the spy who shagged me had been just half as original zany silly and totally enjoyable as its predecessor it would have easily been one of this summer's biggest pleasures . if only . in fact the spy who shagged me is the exact opposite of the original ; instead of refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another the filmmakers bombard us with used-up tired jokes taken directly from the first one . take the scene where austin powers ( again playe,-1
here i sit at my computer about to write my review of the recent action comedy " bait " starring jamie foxx and david morse . this is a review i don't even want to write because i'd just be laying the same criticisms on it that i would with any other so-generic-and-predictable-it's-beyond-ridiculous piece of hollywood fluff . if they're not going to give us the audience just a little credit and put something together with half a brain why should i waste my time and mental energy criticis,-1

the 13th warrior reeks so badly of melodrama and poor acting that it carries a worst scent than a canine's least appetizing residue . the best part of the film would be a close contest between the closing credits and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely white and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the projector . my vote goes for the ending credits where you can start trying to put the awful experience behind you . ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ),-1
i've heard it called " jaws with claws " and that's a fair summation of the plot though that tag line does little to quantify quality . director stephen hopkins ( blown away predator 2 ) and screenwriter william goldman ( maverick misery ) would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to the 20th century . they've stacked the deck with two big stars ( val kil,-1
billy crystal reappears in yet another high concept comedy . he tries to infuse some life into it but it gets bogged down with sentimentality and a lack of sophistication . sammy ( billy crystal ) is a struggling agent at the end of his ropes . he's separated from his wife serena ( kathleen quinlan ) and down to his last serious client . . . in a low-budget film shooting in romania . but in a turn of bad luck sammy wrecks his car . . . only to be mysteriously saved by a giant ( gheo,-1
movies can do the two big es very well : educate and entertain . in the best of all possible worlds they accomplish both . on the red planet they fail entirely . in the near future a manned mission is sent to mars to observe primitive plant growth . this film does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow would be . after some mumbo-jumbo about an ecological disaster on earth and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet the ship falls apart al,-1
capsule : an insult . a stupid and incompetent movie that doesn't even have the benefit of being trashily enjoyable . weslely and woody would do well to leave this off their resumes . money train is one of the worst movies i have ever seen . it's not simply idiotic it's contemptuous of its audience . it tries to make us swallow things that a better movie would be stopped cold by or just plain omit entirely . it's a waste of wesley snipes and woody harrelson who are enjoyable actors in ,-1
alexander dumas' the three musketeers is one of the most often-adapted literary works and for good reason : the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story . perhaps the musketeer a new film that " reimagines " the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix is one adaptation too many . it's just awful : spiritless silly and unforgivably boring transforming the timeless classic into a mish-mash of old-as-time clich ? s and incoherent repetitive action sequences . this time ,-1
when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions i turned to my friend and said " dangerous liaisons for kids ! " it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense owing everything it is to stephen frears' 1988 masterpiece . imagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits . and i was impressed . in fact ,-1
everyone knows that old rule 'never work with children and animals . ' in this latest horror flick mimic case it's 'never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals' instead as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience . the film begins in new york where we see children dying from a mysterious disease which is being carried by cockroaches . dr . susan tyler ( sorvino ) creates a genetically enhanced bug ( the 'juda,-1
this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont's debut as a director 1994 surprise hit speed . but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead . annie ( sandra bullock ) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again . she's going on a cruise with her new boy-friend alex ( jason patric ) and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger ( willem dafoe ) who has a bone to pick with the shipping line . they sacked him after ,-1

the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as 'anywhere but here .

here's something to chew on : what's the favorite food of big cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ? the obvious answer to this question is cardboard because that's the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature . deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer . in fact considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas ,-1
this is an adaptation of h . g . wells' acclaimed novel 'the invisible man' . the actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue . the director is paul verhoven . that plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer should be enough to lure us into the theatre . the problem is to keep us there . i can't imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time . working on a top secret military project sebastian caine ( kevin beacon ) -- an eccentric genius ,-1
because no one demanded it : david duchovny in a romantic comedy ! at last both his romantic magnetism and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources ! the choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot which could be fodder for a valentine's day episode of " the x-files . " bob rueland ( david duchovny ) loses his wife elizabeth ( joely richardson ) in a car accident . at the same time grace briggs ( minnie driver ) is in the hospital waiting for a heart tra,-1
i'm not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream but i'm guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft . seriously this idea--a psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legends--is a great one and i wish it could have been pulled off . the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue . an example : " that [car crash] must've been awful . . . for everyone involved . " you can tell that ,-1
drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on playing the girl outside - the one who's the awkward klutz or the spunky do-it-yourselfer ; the one who just doesn't fit in with the others . she has perfected these characters in movies such as " the wedding singer " and most notably " ever after . " now she's back starring in what could be called a modern-day cinderella fable - " never been kissed . " you know it's a fable because she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her ow,-1

let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official ( and even unofficial ) james bond series . it is so full of self-parody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching a spoof . an omen of what is to come is provided by the pre-credits sequence a dull affair featuring a confrontation between a man ( it's difficult to give a better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie ) and the assassin of the title . a son,-1
since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993's steven spielberg drama " schindler's list " and directed 1993's intelligent " searching for bobby fischer " his new film " a civil action " should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career . what doesn't make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta robert duvall william h . macy and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project w,-1

i can't recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota . for forty minutes or so i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt . then rather suddenly i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter i was whacked in the gut by another . feeling minnesota is a film that made me feel vio,-1
wolfgang petersen's latest the perfect storm is like a pineapple . it only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging - if you try to eat the fruit spikes and all it's going to hurt ? quite a bit . ok maybe that was a confusing analogy so here's my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick : there isn't really much of a story to tell . basically a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat called the andrea gail and gets stuck in the middle ,-1

a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature beams itself onto a russian science vessel . well this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci-fi thriller . anyhow this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the ? virus' known as man . the original crew of the russian vessel ,-1
this movie is based off the wildly popular video-game series of the same name . before this film the game had a few spin-off cartoons- which were ok . but the idea of doing a movie is insane . it should have been animated if it should have been done at all . instead the people do the best they can with a talented cast . yet it still fails . the plot is completely different from the game's plot- i'm not complaining about that . the story involves the mario bros . having a plumbing busi,-1
studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it's a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring cliched individual not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn't be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio which they did according to this film . are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would rea,-1
in the past tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman and the hilarious ed wood but lately his films just don't cut it . sleepy hollow has some unique features but the script is a terrible mess . for those who remember disney's fantastic " adventures of ichabod crane " it is actually superior to this . disney's version was at least interesting while burton's film drags on far too long without any suspense or frights . while the stories are similar the,-1
plot : a rich psychiatrist with a great home life gets his cute daughter kidnapped by some bad guys who want him to extract some information from the mind of one of his nutty patients . of course the patient is not cooperative and the doctor only has a few hours to comply with their demands before they kill his daughter . pretty good premise no ? critique : if you're not a fan of movies packed with plot holes inconsistencies and yes even more plot holes heed my words and skip this,-1
i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world . and i wish that film-makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how _not_ to do it . writer/director daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul-searching in this tale of seth warner ( aidan quinn ) a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires country-western lyrics : his pregnant wife drowns his home is destroyed by a tornado he loses his job and,-1
the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment . with she's all that and varsity blues behind us and several more set for release later in the year the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance . however you wouldn't know it from the quality of the latest entry : jawbreaker . this shockingly bitter candy definitely has a sour center . the most popular and most feared clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma . they have accidentally kille,-1

there is a rule when it comes to movies . a sequel is never as good as the original . there are very few exceptions to this rule and texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation is not one of them . now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie and that this isn't even the first sequel to it you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience . don't be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey ( a time,-1
as a hot-shot defense attorney kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients . he is also an excellent judge of character knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness's testimony . and on top of that he's a damn good trial lawyer . in the opening scene it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty but it doesn't hamper lomax's desire to creativel,-1
i'm not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick because i'm not sure just what the hell ( pardon the expression ) was going on in it . however i can express the most important observation i made of it i . e . i didn't like it . if i had to summarize this film i think i'd conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal . that's the kernel of it anyway . ,-1
an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis' 1981 feature an american werewolf in london . where the original had comedy the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit-coms . where the first installment had chills this one has sequences that are inappropriately unintentionally funny . in short while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre the woeful an ame,-1

you know that a movie has issues when most everyone in the audience comes out laughing . . . and it's not a comedy ! and what a strange career path for director chuck russell . he starts his career off with a decent take on the " nightmare on elm street " series with his debut as director on installment number three . he follows that up with the blob the very next year but waits another six years to do his next piece a little film called the mask starring jim carrey and then one more s,-1
adam sandler vehicles are never anything special but continue to make a load of money . which really goes to show the sad state of cinema today . while good comedies like rushmore to choose a recent example gets limited release and doesn't make a lot of money big daddy got a huge release and has made a lot of cash . it's also nothing special and doesn't deserve the money it's making . but i digress . sandler plays sonny koufax a unemployed new yorker with a seemingly low mental ag,-1
deserves recognition for : making this relatively youthful critic feel extremely old and crotchety20 capsule review : this is what feel-good family entertainment has morphed into in the 90's : an hour-and-a-half commercial disguised as an unnecessary remake in which the defining image is that of a grown man launching a volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass .

movies based on video games such as street fighter or mario bros . have never generated much interest at the box office . but when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 it did surprisingly well . with a simple story a pulsating soundtrack and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy . it got my vote for 'the movie where i expected the least and got the most' . and if you haven't had the opportunity i would defi,-1

there's a scene early on in " jawbreaker " where a character utters the unintentionally prophetic line " that is * so * not funny " . how right she was . this pathetic tale of three high-schoolers who accidentally kill their best friend in a birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly awry is never even remotely funny . or fun . or original . not content with the too-obvious " heathers " heisting the filmmakers proceed to lift freely from a staggering variety of sources including " carrie,-1
can you say " dated " ? you can if you've seen rosemary's baby which like the exorcist was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release . " mystery science theater 3000 " has skewered the bad films of the past but let me tell you it could do a number on the " good " ones too . rosemary's baby stars mia farrow ( from the time she was actually good-looking ) as an innocent housewife and her not-so-innocent,-1
wow a film without any redeeming qualities whatsoever . i'm amazed that someone thought this was a story that must be told on screen . many blacks in hollywood complain that they are not nominated for awards based on their race . i think first they need to concentrate their energy on themselves and stop making movies which makes them look like nothing more than sex-crazed buffoons . even i'm offended by it . bill bellamy is a " player " which means he sleeps with a lot of women and lies,-1
the summer of 00' wasn't a very good one for devout cinephiles . it offered no blair witches or sixth senses ; the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient x-men adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update . nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season that battery-charging ( at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o' shit that moseys into multiplexes ) time o,-1
what do you get when you rip-off good movies like woody allen's bananas and martin scorsese's after hours ? you'd think you'd get the best of both films . instead you get woo . falling in somewhere between def jam's how to be a player ( which was awful ) and booty call ( which was ok ) woo is yet another in the embarassing genre of showing african-americans to be nothing more than sexual buffoons . the whole film plays out as a black version of after hours as wild woman woo ( jada pinket,-1
wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day ? provided of course that you're the victim of a frontal lobotomy . there is in fact no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group . this is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced slick flashy gleefully mindless and hollow to the core . wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters,-1
like a good action film should " metro " has action that keeps you involved . some action films have action sequences that are so conventional our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts .

capsule : dumb dud of an entry in the body heat sweepstakes and now something of a landmark for having spawned a jillion clones . basic instinct's worst crime is that it's not just a bad movie but in many ways an incompetent one as well . it's stupid in itself and stupid to think its audience is as stupid as it is . it's supposed to be a thriller but the plot is dead on its feet and ultimately arbitrary ; it's only put into the movie to jerk us around . it's also supposed to be s,-1

dear god this is a fantastically bad film ! regardless of what i say about knock off you can't grasp its awfulness from my words . you have to see it and experience it for yourself . here's the kicker though -- i suggest that you do so . yes this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure . in fact i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time despite the dr,-1

there should be a requirement that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order to see " mission to mars .

upon first viewing of this movie the phrases " been there " and " done that " come quickly to mind . spy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films the most popular of which are airplane and the naked gun series . stealing stuff can be profitable in this industry but only when you steal the right stuff . what little plot there is involves dick steele aka . agent wd-40 ( leslie nielsen ) trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played by andy,-1
first impressions : critically a close-to-awful film but money-wise it has been doing ( and will continue to do ) great . a sometimes-funny film that sags and lags and oftentimes gets boring . an orginal plot that grows old real fast . one of the only 90 minute films that i've gotten bored through . men in black has defied the odds . when i first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long i thought maybe that this was a poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of ,-1
there are movies that pose a question in its first five minutes and spend the rest of the time trying to answer it . then there are movies that spend the whole time posing questions and try to answer it all in the last five minutes . writer-director john herzfeld's two days in the valley falls into the latter category . weaving together a grabbag of seemingly unrelated characters herzfeld's tries very hard to keep the audience guessing with a altmanesque series of parallel stories . hitmen,-1
 " my name is jack carter and you don't want to know me " says our brooding anti-hero ( sylvester stallone ) . take his advice ! to know this guy is as rewarding as being thrown over a terrace . and to watch this film is almost as painful .

you would think that this film's dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold of a brilliant british comedy and " americanizing " it . you'd be wrong since full blame can be placed on the very folks who wrote and created the series : rowan atkinson robin driscoll and richard curtis . should you ever happen to meet those chaps do me a favor . grab them by the hair and yell really loudly in their ear " what were you thinking ? ! have you ever heard the phrase 'if i,-1
i want to be involved in show business one day . and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse . this movie proves it for me . i was a little worried about the last batman film as i thought joel schumaccer taking over from tim burton would screw it up . i also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne . they didn't . kilmer did a good job and the cast was left to carry the movie which they did ( even jim carrey as the riddler ,-1
for a movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones it is surprising to find the messenger : the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess . in the early to mid 1400's there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman . the church was a dismally dark and oppressive place . france was involved in " the hundred years war " against england . there was no strong political leadership in the country . morale was low there being lit,-1
 " holy man " boasts a sweet gentle comic performance from an unusually subdued eddie murphy and a few moderately funny skits . unfortunately to get to the good stuff you have to sit through a painfully long set-up loads of tedious filler interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering and twitching a superfluous romantic subplot and quite possibly the most annoying performance of robert loggia's career . if ever a movie screamed " wait for video so you can fast-forward through all ,-1

ugh . that about sums this movie up . just ugh . the original godzilla movies are somewhat of a cult classic and when reviewing the previous films each film had a certain degree of intelligence . and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following ; in spite of bad special effects horrible dubbing and a man in a lizard suit they maintained a certain degree of . . . how to put this ? . . . dignity ? not quite the word i'm looking for . you understand right ? an,-1
ripe with explosions mass death and really weird hairdos tsui hark's " double team " must be the result of a tipsy hollywood power lunch that decided jean-claude van damme needs another notch on his bad movie-bedpost and nba superstar dennis rodman should have an acting career . actually in " double team " neither's performance is all that bad . i've always been the one critic to defend van damme -- he possesses a high charisma level that some genre stars ( namely steven seagal ) never,-1

can a horror movie truly be called a horror movie if it has no scares suspense or even eerie elements ? i think not but that's what children of the corn 666 : issac's return wants us to believe . the sixth installment in the horrible worn out series is by far the worst to date . unlike the other five chapters children of the corn 666 is a confusing brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror but either way none of these movies are th,-1

remember tom cruise and brian brown as rival bartenders juggling bottles of booze in " cocktail " ? remember how stupid that looked ? and remember the scantily-clad dancers of " flashdance " getting doused with buckets of water ? well " coyote ugly " does those films five better ( or six better if you count john goodman ) since here we have piper perado maria bello tyra banks melanie lynskey and izabella miko doing the absolut spinning and jiggling thing while pouring pitchers of ,-1
it seemed like the perfect concept . what better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . jim carrey's signed on too ? even better . the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying compl,-1
there's a scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book " screenwriting made easy . " this is funny the first time just 'cause it is but funnier as the film goes on since it's totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it outlined it and then wrote this film . it's like they took the sub-genre of the disaster pic which can be fun and hokey at the same time and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them : the stupid eccentric c,-1
it's been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci-fi opus `mission to mars' and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar . why ? the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera instead shooting for the angle of a feel-good science fiction drama more akin to `2001 : a space odyssey' . i got the feeling that most of my fellow movie-going patrons were,-1
the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john maybury's love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon . as always jacobi's acting is impeccable but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque . the movie convincingly argues that francis played by jacobi was a completely despicable and vain individual but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude . when interviewed by a fawnin,-1
 " payback " brian helgeland's inauspicious directing debut ( coincidentally he previously penned the award-winning screenplay for 1997's " l . a . confidential " ) is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea---a movie with non-stop violence death and villains---and runs with it or should i say barely manages to crawl away with it . mel gibson in yet another disappointing picture ( " conspiracy theory " and " lethal weapon 4 " anyone ? ) ,-1
did i do something bad ? i must have because sitting through this movie was sheer punishment . here's the plot . ricky ( jeff goldblum ) is producer of the good-buy network one of those 24-hour home shopping channels . the new boss ( robert loggia ) plans to can ricky's behind if he doesn't turn the previous months' flat sales numbers around and to add to his problems ricky also has to work with kate ( kelly preston ) the ivy league wunderkind whom the boss has brought with him . ,-1
plot : something about a bunch of kids going into a haunted house and playing out parodies of other horror and non-horror movies . oh yeah there's also something about a ghost possessing the mansion and shit but trust me you won't care much about the " plot " in this film . . . critique : parody movies either work or they don't and this one just doesn't work ! the laughs aren't as pronounced this time around the energy level the gags and all of the characters just seem to be going t,-1
the cartoon is way better . that's the bottom line on disney's incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature . the alliance between disney and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic " home alone " with puppies and not much else . when production of this remake was announced the big question seemed to be " why ? the original cartoon still works so what's the point ? " the answer it appears is to give disney an excuse for yet another massive merchandi,-1
 " spawn " may be somewhat of an older film . in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasn't seen it will finally get to see it ( that is if they see it ) . but i managed to catch it before it made it's way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and god forbid video cassette purchasing . it wasn't the worst film of year by any means . it isn't even on the top 5 of the worst films of the year . but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten which i,-1

it's time to take cover . after a hiatus of about fifteen years the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest . in early 1997 there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone one on television and two in the theaters with dante's peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar . of the two i had heard that dante's peak was the better film so i decided to check it out when it was released on video . the film begins with a slow motion scene of people ,-1
capsule : a ham-handed and over/underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment so muddled it doesn't even know what it's really advocating if anything . a time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations and it's easy to see why : it presents a strong almost rancorously so story ; it is full of good actors ( samuel l . jackson matthew mcconaughey sandra bullock kevin spacey charles dutton ) ; and it's ostensibly about some important social issue th,-1
the above is dialogue from this film taken almost completely in context and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is . it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously . mr . gregg " i'm-having-a-mid-life-crisis " araki the writer and director of this film wants to show how important teenagers are and wants ,-1
 " ladybugs " is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees : the pathetic team who beats the champs ; cross dressing ; and the presence of rodney dangerfield . this picture doesn't play like a comedy for children so who is it aimed at ? and why is it told like a 91-minute sit-com instead of a feature film ? rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee a total schmuck working at a huge corporation . he obviously doesn't have a lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to ,-1
the happy bastard's quick movie review the concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid really . shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control . sadly that is the case with kingpin a film directed by the farrelly brothers the duo that brought us there's something about mary and dumb and dumber . since the duo directed and didn't write the script i can assume that's part of the problem . the story seems good enough : a pr,-1
 " shagadellic ! " " groovy baby ! " " smashing ! " adorn the 1/4 page ad for this movie tabbed as " the #1 comedy in america " as of may 8th . did we attend the same movie ? ! at 87 minutes it seemed overlong like a snl skit on steroids and at any length it seemed unfunny . yes the sets and costumes were an interesting exaggeration of 60s pop frills and yes the concept dealing with a 60s secret agent/pop icon ( played by myers ) awakened from his cryogenic slumber to battl,-1
robin williams this time without a beard returns to drama in this sloppy sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects . he plays chris nielsen who meets annie ( annabella sciora ) and promptly marries her . they have two great kids who sadly die in a car crash . just when it couldn't get any worse chris gets killed in a car crash and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert ( gooding jnr . ) annie can't take the grief anymore and ki,-1
the catch phrase for disney's rocket man is one spoken by fred z . randall ( harland williams ) the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes . " it wasn't me !

a couple of criminals ( mario van peebles and loretta devine ) move into a rich family's house in hopes of conning them out of their jewels . however someone else steals the jewels before they are able to get to them . writer mario van peebles delivers a clever script with several unexpected plot twists but director mario van peebles undermines his own high points with haphazard camera work editing and pacing . it felt as though the film should have been wrapping up at the hour mark b,-1
chill factor is a carbon copy of speed with one notable exception : instead of a speeding bus we now have an ice cream truck . the truck is driven by arlo ( cuba gooding jr . ) and mason ( skeet ulrich ) who have been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a military base by the name of fort mcgruder . this particular weapon ( nicknamed `elvis' ) must be kept below a temperature of 50 degrees or else the shockwave will goo-iffy everything in a mile radiu,-1
retrospective : city of the living dead ( 1980 ) a film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as " dim-witted " . and by golly just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead . although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career this is not one of them . two points in the movie's favour - the impressive camerawork of sergio sal,-1
the comet-disaster flick is a disaster alright . directed by tony scott ( top gun ) it tells the story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on a collision course with earth . and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble . jeez . after a great opening in which an american spaceship plus the city of new york are completely destroyed by a comet shower nasa detects the said asteroid and go into a frenzy . they hire the world's best oil driller ( bruce willi,-1
the original _babe_ was my favorite movie of 1995 a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience . being a surprise commercial and critical success it had no marketing tie-ins which limited its final take . thus babe 2 arrives with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1 . plush dolls vending machines hawking t-shirts and macy's thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money-grubbing . too late . this is a sad review to write because babe 2 not only does _not_,-1
the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer's other comic book adaptation batman and robin . both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty-headed character motivations . in panel-sized morsels implausible plots and " rambo " -esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork but on thirty foot silver screens it's much more difficult to dismiss the,-1
phaedra cinema the distributor of such never-heard-of classics as " soft toilet seats " " trailer : the movie " and " the one armed boxer vs . the flying guillotine " has sneaked its latest release " the sculptress " into a few theaters this weekend hoping to cash in on a handful of halloween holidaygoers looking for a right good scare . " the sculptress " is a scary proposition all right but not in the way its producers intended . from the outset it's easy to see why some of th,-1
here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kong-recipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter . these kinds of movies are marked by an eye-opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters ; a life-and-death plot in which these characters become involved ; the inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters ; ridiculous subplots and sunglass-wearing henchmen . that is not to say that i don't like hong kong influenced movies ; however it is quite obvious that these moviem,-1
after the huge success of " the exorcist " in 1973 a sequel was inevitable and sadly like most horror fims that make money the filmmakers decided to make a ridiculous sequel that makes absolutely no sense at all and to me was extremely pointless wasting linda blair and max von sydow completely . needless dumb sequel flopped in the box office and never gained much success though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time to which i agree with . to start the " story " it,-1
the people who populate the movie 54 are shallow self-absorbed and self-indulgent . in other words they perfectly mirror the era as well as the movie this feature depicts . 54 is the story of that well-publicized new york disco studio 54 the in-place in the '70s where anybody who was anybody went to be ogled photographed and pampered . the difficulty with 54 which was written and directed by mark christopher is that his script takes no point of view . christopher neither condem,-1
i've always been a kevin kline fan silverado fish called wanda pirates of penzance and even his hamlet on pbs' great performances . the minute i saw the trailer for this film i resolved to see it . besides the fact that kline starred it looked like a hilarious film . i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent however as i also thought " wow if there's this much funny stuff in the trailer there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film .

a month ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film i've ever reviewed on paper . i didn't know at the time that i'd soon encounter and despise batman & robin which has just overtaken speed 2 as the picture least worthy of your attention this summer . as directed by joel schumacher ( who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and isn't very good at either ) b & r is one long excuse for a taco bell promotion . the plot which has mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma th,-1
call " hush " " stop or my mom will kill . " or " mommy fearest . " or " the hand that robs the cradle . " call it whatever you want but certainly don't see it unless you're in desperate need of a bad movie-induced chuckle -- " hush " scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure . chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent post-production tinkering ( it was supposed to open about a year ago ) the latter of which appears to have giv,-1
a big busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch the great white hype stars samuel l . jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging pay-per-view revenues is to " invent " a white contender ( peter berg ) to challenge his black heavyweight " champ " ( damon wayans ) . ( the logic is that people will pay more to see black vs . white than black vs . black . ) he may be right in an absurdly accurate way but the film doesn't give us a reason to care . as a s,-1

there ? s nothing quite like a gory anime . really and this is the truth no other genre in film gets away with such violence without a word being said in the media about it . with anime a common shot is watching a body getting quickly cut in two and the rest of the insides falling out seconds afterword . this is a standard practice in anime or at least the half dozen or so titles that i ? ve seen . vampire hunter d is a gory gory film . if they ever made a live version of the fi,-1

by starring in amy heckerling's " clueless " two summers ago alicia silverstone proved she wasn't just another pretty pouty ingenue showing a buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs -- namely a stint as the aerosmith girl and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of " the crush " -- out of the water . her only work since that 1995 gem has been in june's " batman & robin " where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl . now she's the star and producer of " excess bagg,-1
the tagline on random hearts reads " in a perfect world they never would have met . " in a perfect world i never would have seen this movie . the biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film kay chandler ( kristin scott thomas ) and dutch van den broeck ( harrison ford ) are the only two major characters alive ; resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious two-hours-and-then-some production . dutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the,-1
in double jeopardy the stakes are high . think of the plot as a rehash of sleeping with the enemy and then rearrange the details and the gender of the stalker . the finished product although able to maintain the viewer's attention is a predictable and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script . `alex i'll take homicide for $400 . . .

hollywood never fails to astound me . every time i think those coked-up little buggers have hit rock bottom ; they come up with a new excavating tool . i was truly convinced that " wild wild west " marked 1999 studio filmmaking at its most hapless but then along comes " end of days " to prove me wrong . this big budget brain dead apocalyptic thriller bludgeons its audience with overwrought music grisly violence explosions galore and lots of cheesy special effects . the result ? noth,-1
i have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series . if there's a will there's a way ; and i believe that anything no matter how great or revered can be effectively improved upon . this is the reason that i responded so well to gus van sant's universally panned update of psycho ; i thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience but also very on-par with an original . but i do have a big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad . you see the point ,-1
when the mediums in question are video game and feature film has there ever been a respective here-to-there transformation that achieved any ground higher than noodle-headed mediocrity ? " super mario bros .

a backdrop of new year's eve in 1981 would seem to lend itself to a great party movie . the decor possibilities are endless - disco balls had yet to migrate into the dark corners of the attic big hair was worth its weight in aquanet and the louder the fashion the better the look . but despite this setting these details and a soundtrack that includes some 40-plus irresistible hits from the early days of the me decade something is inherently wrong with " 200 cigarettes .

the premise of the new james wong film final destination is that alex browning the protagonist prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane thereby cheating fate . however fate is not so easily bested and alex's friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances . essentially this premise is a clever-way to make a slasher-flick without the slasher . unfortunately this is practically the only clever thing about the film . as far as teen horror flicks go final,-1

as any reasonable human being would i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things . i am befuddled by fight club . now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later . perhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time . perhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate and understand ,-1

even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality . like everyone else dreyfuss has bills to pay so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies . consequently while his career highlights include jaws close encounters of the third kind stakeout and tin men his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador let it ride and now krippendorf's,-1

at one point in this movie there is a staging of an opera that goes completely wrong . but one member of the crowd stands up and cheers thinking the performance was planned and applauding it for their efforts . that's " dirty work " in a nutshell . a very different kind of movie . this is not a movie that i can easily review . the critic in me analyzes the structure plot acting characters . . . and tells me this movie is terrible . but the norm macdonald fan in me had me rol,-1
to sum the entire film " 54 " up in one sentence it would be : watch a vh1 documentary instead . " 54 " seems like someone brought william faulkner into 1978 brought him into studio 54 got him really drunk told him to write about it and then dumbed that down to be released to the public . a sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex drugs and disco . the narrator shane o'shae ( ryan phillippe ) works as a grease mo,-1

i think we should as responsible citizens all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie . he's changing the cinema as we know it--and for the worst . i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues epilogues etc . the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day . ho ho . normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr . carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable . i laughed once,-1

you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year . they're obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes ( having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big box-office holiday season ) . combine that with howie long's first starring action role and you've got a doozy of a movie that while not as bad as it could have been isn't a very good film . howie stars as an ace smokejumper ( a firefighter who parachu,-1
the blues brothers was a wonderful film a hilarious comedy packed with good music . it cried out for a sequel but john belushi's untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea . however eighteen years have passed and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged . unfortunately it's a sequel not worthy of the original . the film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended . elwood blues ( dan aykroyd ) is just getting out of jail his brother jake having recently died . a,-1
michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels many of which are science fiction . the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel . so in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a big-budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel . congo failed and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare a whole lot better . it a little better than just okay n,-1
american pie 2 is filled with laughs . but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater . i'm no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy . but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself . what separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart . of the o,-1

well lets see . . . i'm not quite sure how to review this film based on its laughter factor . well yeah i can it's not funny . ok so i laughed one time which warranted the 1/2 star but other than that i sat in my seat wondering when this pos would be over ( which at a running time of 107 minutes seemed like forever ! ) . in fact this could be the un-funniest movie i've seen in a long time if not the un-funniest . let me be the first to say " ready to rumble " is a huge disappoin,-1
plunkett & macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott brother of ridley and tony . naturally this got me worried . would jake's talent be inherited from ridley or tony ? if it was from ridley than the movie would be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in . if it was from tony it would be wham bang drivel . unfortunately the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm . carlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen plunkett ( carlyle ) who is poor and,-1
capsule : silly and inane adaptation of gibson's short story which is nowhere in sight . gibson's script only adds insult to injury . johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie . i say " awesomely " because it's one thing to fail but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged . keanur reeves ( who is terrible ) stars as johnny an " information courier " who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head . he is given " one last jo,-1
when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie . however since this film also featured michael madsen more than capable character actor this time in the role of protagonist the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt . however the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials - madsen plays richard montana tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse a,-1
what are the warning signs of a * terrible * movie ? making it's debut at the dollar theater ? locally chairman of the board did just that . having the annoying prop comic scott thompson ( better known as carrot top ) in the lead role ? chairman of the board once again . how about an overly exhausted paper thin plot approached with utter incompetence ? did somebody say chairman of the board ? that's right carrot top's long dreaded major motion picture debut ( at least for a starri,-1
you don't look at a ren ? magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning . you likewise don't look at one for 88 minutes straight . surrealist works are notable for their quirks and they are fun but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting . that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died a surrealistic hyperactive comedy with no dialogue . it's not a silent movie ; there is lots of atmospheric music occasional screams and weird sound effects but no,-1
well as i check my score card for what i've done this holiday weekend it reads good ideas : 0 and dumb ideas : 1 . i don't know what i was thinking when i decided to watch this movie . but in my defense i can only say that it was someone else who urged me to see this with him . the film that i'm talking about is `a night at the roxbury ' one of those offerings based on a saturday night live skit . wayne and garth these two are not . rather we meet doug and steve butabi ( the act,-1
terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of james jones' world war ii novel . unfortunately he buried it within an overlong and overreaching 3-hour long pseudo-epic . this is a shame because the film features an outstanding performance by nick nolte . the best scene is when nick nolte's character lt . col . tall is forced to deal with the direct refusal by capt . staros ( elias koteas ) to execute an order . nolte's reaction and transformation may be the best work of,-1
an 18-foot-high 43-foot-long dragon is the computer-generated co- star of this strictly-by-the-numbers sword 'n' sorcery flick . as voiced by sean connery " draco " is a surprisingly expressive creation who is well-deserving of his 23 minutes of screen time . he walks talks flies fries and even fakes his own death all with the help of 96 computer-aided animators . too bad that ilm ( industrial light and magic ) couldn't spare some special effects for dragonheart's * human * co-s,-1
1989's " major league " was a delightful surprise . i didn't expect much of it when i decided to watch it on cable but it proved to be fresh and funny . however when the appeal of a movie is its freshness the sequels are virtually guaranteed to be stale . that's certainly true of " major league ii " and the most recent entry " major league : back to the minors . " the title is of course a contradiction . shouldn't it be " minor league ? " that contradiction suggests the lengths,-1
these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes . but only a few years ago before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers . sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south . the way to regain popularity and prestige they thought was the use the same formulas characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place . one of s,-1
i have never been so confused after watching a movie . " meet joe black " is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year with a cinematography music and cast that will dazzle most of us . at the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season . at first you marvel at the elegant direction graceful cinematography and sensual musical score . then you'll wait for something to happen for half an hour but when you final,-1
keep cool a chinese film directed by semi-accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang was one of the kickoff films for this year's hawaii international film festival . on the day it premiered lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater . they need not have wasted their time . the movie is billed as a comedy but is surprisingly bereft of humor . there are noticeable attempts at laughs but very few ,-1
although i had not been a viewer of the " rugrats " television series i went into their first animated feature film " the rugrats movie " with a positive attitude . the trailer looked cute enough after all . after seeing it i think the words in my recent " antz " review in which i stated that it was the worst film of its type since 1995's " the pebble and the penguin " were a bit premature . " the rugrats movie " is bottom-of-the-barrel children's fare at its worst and star,-1
plunkett & macleane is a period piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions . i have nothing against the mtv approach to filmmaking -- used properly it can save a movie ( see stigmata ) -- but it ruins this one making a muddled incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting premise . there are certain genres that just don't go together . the film opens with a sequence that i still don't understand . it involves some sort of prison outbreak a robbery and a gem that keeps being eaten ,-1
 * this review contains spoilers * as with most of her films director amy heckerling's latest loser seesaws between unpleasant and artificial and is sometimes both at once . when she tackles big issues such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high it's impossible to tell whether she's being matter-of-fact or glib about them ( they carry an almost documentary starkness ) but whatever the case she continually refuses to comment politically . such is the sitcom tendency of her ,-1
movie concepts are often pitched to producers with mathematical formulas involving successful films of the past . so undoubtedly one day someone said " 'evolution ? ' it's 'ghostbusters' plus 'men in black' plus 'tremors .

vikings v . bears ? no this isn't the lineup for monday night football . rather these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in " the 13th warrior " a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory . based on michael crichton's book eaters of the dead this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought . their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest war,-1
apparently when crap calls jim carrey answers . here he is mugging it up in countless unfunny ways for the fifth time his second go-around in the role of pet detective ace ventura . that means more talking ass-cracks penis jokes and cries of " al-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-lrighty then . " it all adds up to a sequel that makes the original resemble schindler's list in terms of dramatic merit or lack of . granted there are a few laughs amid the constant barrage of pre-school humor but ,-1
this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground despite some good performances from a basically competent cast . eddie ( sean penn ) and maureen ( robin wright penn ) are a not-so-happily married couple down on their luck . living in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city they spend what little income they have at the local bar owned by shorty ( stanton ) eddie's best friend and his wife georgie ( mazar ) . maureen and eddie share an odd rel,-1
michael richards leaves his spot as kramer on the infamous seinfeld tv sitcom for a stint as a lanky goofy best friend to jeff daniels' lawyer character in this ill-fated and unfunny " comedy " . plot : richard the actor ( richards ) has to take the place of charles the lawyer ( daniels ) in a real court case after charles is left unintelligible from a night of heavy drinking at his bachelor party . the film follows the antics of the two men as they try to get away with their tomfooler,-1
the general's daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film . it's confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction . that however is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller . the punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge ,-1

 " have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming ? " obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment and so to finish us utterly they have now released " urban legends : final cut " . this is another " scream " -like feature consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip-offs from the most pointless movies of all time . amy ( jennifer morrison ) is a film student who,-1

i wont even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films . i saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien 3 but i have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them . so take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective : alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard days work . i didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful ; most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome aft,-1

this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset : the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st . elsewhere for several years and i had understood that the director/screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also . i am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations nor were they satisfactory . if i had to list a reason why . . . . but that would be getting ahead of myself ; besides it's not immediately clear as there are,-1
i love movies . i really do . every time i watch great movies like goodfellas ( 1990 ) or raiders of the lost ark ( 1981 ) a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent skill and entertainment that is on display . even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1/3 ( 1994 ) or ghostbusters ii ( 1988 ) while not exactly brilliantly well made are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value . then there's my favourite martian the exact opposite of what a movie ,-1
the thirteenth floor is a bland obligatory exercise in genre film-making . if i hadn't recently watched the matrix and open your eyes -- both of which are similar but far superior -- i might have been a little nicer to this picture . craig bierko makes an adequate hero as douglas hall the rich co-creator of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss ( armin mueller-stahl ) . everything that was subtle and smart about the previously mentioned films i,-1
alexandre dumas meets hong kong action with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft-played character of dashing swordsman d'artagnon in director peter hyam's adventure " the musketeer . " for some reason that i may figure out later i don't know why the time money and effort were put into the making of " the musketeer . " it may be that someone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this film',-1
i think maybe it's time for the batman series to be put to rest . not only has the first two films' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a " superhero " been abandoned but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all-out camp with few traces of the self-mocking restraint of the relatively light-hearted third installment . let me give you an example : in the first scene of the movie batman ( george clooney ) and robin ( ,-1
in my opinion a movie reviewer's most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion . but with soul survivors i'm so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous uncontrollable rant obligations damned . however protocol forces me to do otherwise . soul survivors tells the story of four college-bound friends : cassandra ( melissa sagemiller ) is sweet and innocent . party girl annabel ( eliza dushku of bring it on ) is dating world-weary harva,-1

" robert de niro ( " taxi driver " " raging bull " ) billy crystal ( " city slickers " ) lisa kudrow ( " the opposite of sex " ) and director harold ramis ( " national lampoon's vacation " ) . these are usually reliable filmmakers ( well okay crystal has been in a sizable slump lately ) and tellingly the first half-hour of " analyze this " was very funny . unf,-1
as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment hollywood doesn't loose the oppertunity to get involved by telling stories and expressing opinions . this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l . jackson ) . they fought side by side in vietnam where childers saved hodges' life by shooting an unarmed pow . that's against the rules ,-1

8mm is not going to enlighten your day . it's a dark grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence . not only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess you'll require a lot of patience as well . nicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late . he wore a bizarre get-up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely los,-1

the characters in jonathan lynn's " the whole nine yards " yet another in an endless recent string of mob comedies ( 1999's " analyze this " and " mickey blue eyes " 2000's " gun shy " ) are rarely ever written as real people but merely as one-dimensional caricatures . when an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed it is not to service the character development or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations but to accommodate the convoluted plot . in a ligh,-1
so much for sweet returns . after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80's slasher movies starting with 1996's " scream " and followed by " scream 2 " " urban legend " and the original " i know what you did last summer " a film like " i still know what you did last summer " was bound to be made sooner or late . it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out and that is because they reached for the lowes,-1
around the end of 1998 a japanese cartoon came to the usa television and really wasn't that big . in fact not many people even knew what pokemon was but in 1999 it hit big with kids and adults alike and became one of the biggest franchises and merchandise seller of all time . in fact it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon : the first movie which for what it was wasn't all that bad . it grossed $31 million in its opening weekend and went on to make almost $90 million . fan,-1
its a stupid little movie that trys to be clever and sophisticated yet trys a bit too hard . with the voices of woody allen gene hackman jennifer lopez sylvester stallone and sharon stone this computer-animated yak-fest ( think toy story [1996] filled with used merchandising ) is one for the ant-eaters . the main story is the independence of a worker named z ( allen ) . he wants more to life than just digging away underground for the colony . when he finds out about ``insectopia ,-1
after the recent animated debacles of " a rugrats movie " and " a bug's life " i am seriously considering raising my highly negative rating on dreamworks' other insect film from october " antz .

the ads make " hanging up " seem like an upbeat comedy about a rascally father and his three daughters . anyone who went to the movie expecting that left disappointed . all of the movie's funny scenes were included in the ad . so what do we get ? eve marks ( meg ryan ) just put her father lou mozell ( walter matthau ) into a hospital . once upon a time lou was a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his now-estranged wife . his one great moment in life was writing a film for john ,-1
this is the worst movie i've seen since the " so bad i walked out on it " " jingle all the way " . it is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap . it is crap through and through . nothing works in this film as to be expected from joel schumacher who has made only one watchable film in his entire career ( that being " cousins " ) . here's a man who admits he's a medicore director a rather charmingly self-effacing statement . but truth be told he is much worse tha,-1
when i ponder childhood memories past one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the " inspector gadget " tv show with my older brother . truth be told we were rabid fanatics ; our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr . claw the inspector's arch nemesis . i was never a biggie on nostalgia but you just can't help but,-1
perhaps if the impostors didn't have so much going for it it wouldn't have been such a tremendous disappointment . written directed and produced by one of its two stars stanley tucci whose last picture was the indie smash hit big night the impostors almost never catches fire . sputtering like a two-day old campfire the story plays like an ad-lib sketch that was never polished or completed . the film's other star oliver platt was hilarious as the senator's aide in bulworth ,-1
this was the last carry on movie ( if you discount 'carry on columbus' as a carry on movie ) and was made by a new production company . based in central london this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert ( suzanne danielle ) to bed her husband emile the french ambassador ( kenneth williams ) . when he seems unwilling she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes such as the prime minister and the u . s . ambassador . her antics get her into trouble and the british press,-1
if you're debating whether or not to see _breakfast_of_champions_ ask yourself one simple question : do you want to see nick nolte in lingerie ? the only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph's chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the cross-section of the population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight . everyone else--and i'm hoping that's most people--would be wise to steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess . actually though the sigh,-1
suicide is pointless everyone should know that . so what's this movie like ? you guessed it . . . pointless . the virgin suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them . when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide it sets in motion a series of events that will change the lives of many people forever . that's what the press materials for the film probably say . now here's what i say : the virgin suicide,-1
the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities . the best tales of the genre deal with mankind's struggle for survival or knowledge . such popular and noteworthy tomes as " stranger in a strange land " by robert heinlein " childhood's end " by arthur c . clarke and " man in the high castle " and " do androids dream of electric sheep " by philip k . dick all deal with man's need for identity and struggle for self worth . hollywood has regular,-1
the working title for no looking back was long time nothing new and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture . even though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics . writer/director edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn't spent their life in seclusion . instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the procee,-1
the job of the film critic is to see a movie and write a review of it that tells you what it's about and why it's good or bad . i feel kind of embarrassed to admit this but i after having seen " get carter " i really can't tell you what it's about although i could go on and on about how and why it's a bad movie . " get carter " falls into that category of ? movies that continue to be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside of a hollywood executive board room . you might call them the " ,-1
i've got to admit it . . . i'm a huge jim carrey fan . i loved the first ace ventura as well as the mask and dumb and dumber--and even in batman forever ( which was a pretty awful movie ) carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good . until i saw ace ventura 2 i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying . sadly ace ventura 2 shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be . carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace mo,-1
for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer hard boiled face off ) appears to have made an exciting elegant charming spy thriller kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them . sadly as the picture progresses the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up two-hour long episode of magyuver . and not a particu,-1
every now and then reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed . most of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact either good or bad that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings . but sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons . i love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review . the impression left by the film wasn't overwhelming - on the contrary there were,-1
the only two really good things that i can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows : jane march was very cute as jane and the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes in length . if you haven't already figured it out i didn't like this movie very much . the plot was boring and contrived to the extreme . tarzan ( casper van dien ) has now left the jungle and living in civilized society . he is just days away from his impending marriage to jane played by the aptly named jane march,-1

so i went and saw this film right it was called " battlefield : earth " i was never interested in the previews and never too terribly interested in the book nor do i find scientology interesting but after reading advanced reviews of how bad this film really is i had that weird urge just to watch it . well let me be the first to say and so far in my view it's safe to say : battlefield : earth might be the worst film i have ever seen yes even worse than " mr . magoo " " blue in ,-1

a fullyloaded entertainment review : website coming soon ! hunter s . thompson's fear and loathing in las vegas written in 1971 is already an american classic ; not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post-psychedelia of the 1960's but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as " gonzo " . soon after the book was written hunter s . thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke . and that is the problem with fear an,-1
filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a dull dreary and overused idea . doug liman ( swingers ) director of the ultra-hip and severely dark comedy go is an example of just such a filmmaker . in his latest he gives the viewers a raucous neon-lit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a drug-infested path of misadventure as director . but he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multi-tiered movie and he fails to connec,-1
i feel sorry for the financial backers of " waterworld " which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made ( at $172 million ! ) and is also one of the stupidest - boy did they get ripped off ! in fact this film is not really a movie but more of an amusement park ride with a plot . it's not even just another case of cliches strung together ( well it is that too ) it's something that's painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws . kevin costner stars as a man who is some ,-1
to watch `battlefield earth' is to wallow in misery . it is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history . it has a clumsily told story insipid dialogue shallow characterizations ugly scene transitions no evidence of dramatic arc headache-inducing sound effects and a resolution that is completely implausible . worse there's the promise of a sequel . why ? ! save your money . some films go quickly to video . this one however should go straight to the sc,-1

it's a rare treat when a quality horror film is released in the theater . and unfortunately with man's best friend we'll be waiting a while longer . the film stars ally sheedy and lance henrikson in a tale of bio-genetics gone wrong . sheedy plays a nosy reporter whose need for a " good " story provokes her to snoop inside of emax a poorly guarded million dollar bio-lab that she finds herself effortlessly intruding . the result : she unleashes the experimental wonder dog named max a ge,-1
joe versus the volcano is really one of the worse movies made in very recent memory . the strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it . it has a solid cast with tom hanks & meg ryan as the lead roles . but you can never judge a movie by its cast . . . if there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano it is that the plot is original . unfortunately it is also incredibly stupid . the movie begins with joe ( tom hanks ) going to work . this opening sequence i,-1
 " be gentle " urges natasha henstridge to matthew perry in " the whole nine yards . " " i haven't made love in five years . " " neither have i " rebuts perry . " i'm married ! " if jonathan lynn's latest comedy relied simply on jokes of that caliber--and it certainly tries--then it'd be an innocuous if rather obvious little film . instead its failings go much deeper . first off who hasn't had enough of the tough wiseguy intimidates the timid wise guy genre ? if you want to mak,-1
i'm going to start this review off with a hypothetical question . let's say you've just been in a car accident and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious . your friends have left to go get help and you're waiting to see if the victim wakes up . a tow-truck comes along and the driver hops out of the truck to see what's going on . he then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck . do you : a ) run away screaming for your life staying away from the main roa,-1
susan granger's review of " session 9 " ( usa films ) sometimes you just get more than your bargained for . . . like when boston-based hazmat elimination run by scottish actor peter mullan and his trusty assistant david caruso assures a town engineer ( paul guilifoyle ) that they can remove insidious asbestos fibers from a victorian hospital facility in a week . erected in 1871 deserted and decomposing since 1985 the danvers mental hospital is one of the most malevolent " locations,-1
by the time dennis quaid the ostensible star of switchback makes his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark you may find yourself wondering why he bothered . after all writer/director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines . the first finds amarillo texas sheriff buck olmstead ( r . lee ermey ) facing a hotly-contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction . as olmstead begins his in,-1
gregg araki's the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made . so why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus ? first of all some of the reviews were fairly positive . also the cast consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars ( including christopher knight eve plumb shannen doherty and david leisure ) was promising . last of all i wanted to give arraki one more chance . i mean the guy can't be that untalented can he ? the answer to that,-1
sometimes when i decide to write a short story or a poem i think of a title first and then think of a subject to go with it . it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence . i wouldn't be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it . the title sequence is so good so ominous and original that it had me engrossed before th,-1

note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . to assess alex cox's film the winner as a loser would be so indolent . it would be derisive . it would be glib . it would be dismissive . it would be entirely accurate . rarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner a would-be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious unfunny and unengaging . the film attempts to be fresh and quirky utilising a myriad of colourful charact,-1
in the james bond film " diamonds are forever " tiffany case asks 007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads . bond's response is that it doesn't really matter as long as collars and cuffs match . well collars and cuffs don't match in " the real blonde .

 " tina ! ! ! fetch me the axe ! ! ! " a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands . it wasn't just the film's disappointing box office performance . indeed in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two three even six times . no the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of s,-1
phil ( radmar jao ) has a hairy problem . his beard is growing so rapidly that he has to shave every hour . he recently met the author of a non-fiction book on lycanthropy also referred to in the movie as werewolfism and phil now believes that his problem is that he has become a werewolf . using enough chains and handcuffs to be a hit at a sadomasochists convention he ties himself in at night lest his urges overcome him . and phil is just one of the many quirky characters that inhabit ,-1
ladies and gentlemen payback is the most expensive episode of " the equalizer " i've ever seen . gibson plays porter a burglar shot and left for dead by his wife ( deborah kara unger in an all-too-brief cameo ) and partner ( henry ) after a successful heist . as a morgue attendant sets about removing the bullets from porter's back porter miraculously springs back to life . he makes it his mission as a walking dead man without a conscience to exact revenge on those who screwed him ,-1
when you've run out of old tv shows to turn into movies i guess you try video games . why did i go to see mortal kombat : annihilation ? the quest to seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw . this film was a bunch of fighting yelling special effects and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack . the plot is fairly simple : a portal has opened between our world and the " outworld " allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn ( bri,-1
the swooping shots across darkened rooftops suggest a very tim burton movie but alas no caped crusader descends to save * this * film . instead it's a skeletal housemaid ( julia roberts ) who must bear witness to this unfortunate retelling of " dr . jekyll and mr . hyde .

i didn't come into city of angels expecting greatness . i've never seen wim wenders' wings of desire the classic movie upon which city is loosely based . then again i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device with the little mermaid ( both the disney version and the original folktale ) being among them that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold . unfortunately city of angels ended up fulfilling few of,-1
200 cigarettes takes place on new year's eve 1981 . monica played by martha plimpton is having a huge new year's party . everyone in town is trying to get there but some are caught up in other things . this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes . as we meet the characters headed towards the party we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal and not interesting at all . this disappointed me greatly . the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get t,-1
i'll bet right now you're just lounging by the pool humming " i will always love you " and wistfully recalling your candlelight dinners with success . it isn't necessarily over for you : i say you still have enough charm that you could avoid starring in " kevin !

i'll be the first to admit it . when you mention the book great expectations i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch . yes it's a classic of literature but it was a rather dry one shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine . certainly the experience wasn't truly that bad but to quote ethan hawke in the lat,-1
the one question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film . since june i haven't been able to turn on the tv or go to the movies without getting hit by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky shrieking out a-ha's " take on me " in his yellow miata . why would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine ? honestly i was hoping that all the goofball ads were actually a front for a decently funny movi,-1

the first in a very long list of things wrong with " i still know what you did last summer " is the title . think about it for a second . if the last movie was called " i know what you did last summer " wouldn't the next movie have to be " i still know what you did two summers ago " ? if anyone working on this movie had an i . q . greater than five would have thought about it logically and said " hey . . . wait a minute " . but alas the people behind this film are obviously idiots ,-1
 " there's nothing new under the sun " is a phrase often used when the speaker actually means " let's find something to copy . " of course there are very few completely original ideas . even earth-shattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience . there is after all no need to re-invent the wheel time after time . recently it seems that hollywood doesn't feel the need to even re-write the script . my understanding of the word " sequel " is a continuation of the story,-1
the scene at the end of 1989's `dead poets society ' when robin williams' english students stand up on their desk and say `captain my captain ' gets me every time . unfortunately the court room scene near the end of robin's newest film `patch adams ' doesn't have anywhere near the same impact . from the surface `patch adams' looks very promising . it's a story about a not so young man patch adams ( robin williams ) who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people . ,-1

 " jack frost " is one of those dumb corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching . this does not come as a surprise since the studio that made it is warner brothers who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other . jack frost ( michael keaton ) is a struggling middle-aged rock musician who loves his wife gabby ( kelly preston ) and 11-year-old son charlie ( jose,-1
you think that these people only exist in the movies but trust me they're as real as life . i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person's brain with microwaves . then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections . i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting p,-1
my son and i share a perverse predilection for bad movies . we are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills the corny dialog the ludicrous premises and the bad acting . since other family members aspire to higher forms of entertainment we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together . i can't remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until species 2 came along . he was not amused . i on the other hand was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements ,-1
wesley snipes is a master of selecting bad action roles . murder at 1600 u . s . marshals money train drop zone boiling point and the ultimate camp film - passenger 57 . the art of war is another entry in this very ugly and unique category . ultimately it is little more than a ridiculous action film with a plot as believable as the warren report ugly violence that would have made peckinpah cringe and terrible acting by b-list actors like michael biehn and anne archer . oddly ,-1
i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy . it's not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity but there it was nonetheless . i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 . in a word it's the same thing that's wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing . more to the point it',-1
i have a confession . even though i am a movie junkie-i saw eye of the beholder and yet i still watch movies-i've never seen any of the original godzillas . ( note that godzilla 2000 is not a sequel to the u . s . godzilla released in 1998 ; it's the american release of a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira ni-sen mireniamu . ) so part of me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000-the latest entry in an almost 50-year old franchise . this was a long-awaited treat ,-1

what hath kevin williamson wrought ? while the horror movie revival spurred on by his _scream_ has yielded a few decent entries in the genre--_i_know_what_you_did_last_summer_ _halloween : _h20_ and _scream_2_ --it must be noted that williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films . those williamson-less post-_scream_ efforts among them _wishmaster_ and the recent _disturbing_behavior_ have been frightening all right--frighteningly insultingly _bad_ . add to that list _u,-1
warner brothers has scored another marketing coup . the one-two punch was started in the summer with the release of batman forever . trailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel . carrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the ever-wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video ( $11 . 99 at wal-mart ) ; a mere two weeks before carrey's return in this marketwise but misf,-1

there have been merchant-ivory costume dramas with more of a pulse than " the mod squad " a self-consciously " hip " cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many baby-boomers . well said " squad " certainly won't be a pleasant viewing experience for them or anybody else maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been geared towards . a contemporary take on this decidedly '70s show doesn't exactly seem unwarranted but one wonders if the mold it acc,-1
ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film . it's more of a show a big commercial for ted turner's world championship wrestling ( wcw ) . the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page goldberg and sting . the story is very minimal and basic . there are these two guys gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan ) . they are two twenty-something wrestling fans from wyoming . ,-1
david schwimmer ( from the television series " friends " ) stars as a sensitive ( and slightly neurotic ) single guy who gets more than he expected from the grieving mother ( barbara hershey ) of a classmate he can't remember . hello mrs . robinson ! though quite cute as a romantic comedy the pallbearer is paced like a funeral march . the characters act react and interact at half-speed making for one * excruciatingly * long sit .

 " saving silverman " is a good example of a good comedy gone bad . as a love story it is good however as a comedy it falls flat on it's face . i think throughout the short 90 minutes i laughed a total of seven times . . . and those were just chuckles at the most ! the movie doesn't have the oomph to make it a great movie and doesn't have the script to make it a funny movie . wayne lefessier ( steven zahn ) j . d . mcnugent ( jack black ) and darren silverman ( jason biggs ) have gr,-1
one of my brother's favorite movies is h . b . halicki's 1974 cult flick " gone is sixty seconds " one of the best products of the car-chase genre that provided drive-in fare during the 1970's . chase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue but they had a strong visceral appeal . although it boasts a bigger budget and familiar stars the remake of " gone in sixty seconds " is relatively weak and dull . randall " memphis " raines ( nicolas cage ) is a retired car thief who runs a go-cart,-1
steve martin is one of the funniest men alive . if you can take that as a true statement then your disappointment at this film will equal mine . martin can be hilarious creating some of the best laugh-out-loud experiences that have ever taken place in movie theaters . you won't find any of them here . the old television series that this is based on has its moments of humor and wit . bilko ( and the name isn't an accident ) is the head of an army motor pool group but his passion is his,-1
bad . bad . bad . that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls . if that summary isn't enough for you how about t&a t&a t&a ? still haven't got the point ? other than director russ meyer's predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie . that is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger,-1
who knew that in 16 years eddie murphy who made such a brash raucous big-screen splash in _48_hrs . _ would become . . . cuddly . the disconcerting trend begun in this summer's cutesy largely laugh-free _doctor_dolittle_ continues with this earnest-to-a-fault dramedy . although he is top-billed here murphy is merely support for jeff goldblum who plays ricky hayman the programming director at a home shopping network . sales are way down and ricky's job hangs by a thread until,-1
 " pokemon 3 : the movie " has a lot of bad things in it . first of all it's a plot heavy mess that has bad voice talents badly written script and fantastic animation . the first film came out the end of 1999 and was a huge hit grossing almost $90 million domestically . a sequel soon followed and even made $45 million . warner has released their third movie based on the immensely popular video game and tv series and its a waste of time and celluloid . this time ash ketchum and his friends,-1
1 . he doesn't have a hard-to-decipher accent 2 . he doesn't always speak in a monotone and 3 . his face doesn't always wear the same impassive expression . in short the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad but too bad to be good . unfortunately the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle firestorm which is just plain awful . one of the most glaring problems with long ( who made his acting debut in john woo's broken arrow ) is that ,-1
seen at : amc old pasadena 8 pasadena ca ( in sdds ) paul verhoeven's last movie showgirls had a bad script bad acting and a " plot " ( i use the word in its loosest possible sense ) that served only to allow lots of sex and nudity . it stank . starship troopers has a bad script bad acting and a " plot " that serves only to allow lots of violence and gore . it stinks . nobody will watch this movie for the plot but here's a brief synopsis anyway . some friends straight out,-1
often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into the call of the oboe ( o toque do oboe ) is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray . many elements of the film are solid and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know but they simply don't convert into a solid work . although a setting is never established it becomes apparent . the film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day . the,-1
a friend invites you to a movie . this film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare and be grounded in reality . the plot is as follows : after a terrifying incident a mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city . they need fresh air to get some perspective maybe to start over . romance begins to brew however as one of the locals played by an international superstar in rugged clothing sparks things up ,-1
steve martin shines but sgt . bilko fails to impress based on the popular 50's sitcom sgt . bilko follows the string of old-sitcoms-to-movie conversion fever . remember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back ? ( brady bunch was a moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped ) . i do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy but the tv-conversion-movies are hitting our screens like wildfire,-1
look ! the new version of " psycho " came out and the world didn't end ! i guess gus van sant really isn't the bringer of the apocalypse ! unfortunately though that " psycho " didn't end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it . van sant's controversial " re-telling " of alfred hitchcock's classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere ( even before it premiered . ) without benefit of an actual viewing many have said that the film will at best suck . b,-1
an american werewolf in london is john landis' groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england . the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects . more specifically the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character . even twenty years after its release that part of the movie is still impressive . although i would have to say that it really is the only,-1

attention moviegoers : you are about to enter a meaning-free zone . should the sound system malfunction during your viewing of 200 cigarettes do not panic . the film will work just as well as a silent movie . chronicling the meaningless lives of vain yuppie types the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films ( last days of disco barcelona and metropolitan ) but without any of his acerbic wit and the inviting style of his writing . first-time writer shana larsen makes th,-1
if you've seen the trailers or commercials it's rather difficult to really figure out what this movie has in store . well it's hard to tell after watching the movie as well . bruce willis is a resident of the future and it is a rather bleak future . the world's population had disintigrated into a mere 200 000 and is no longer ruled by humans but animals . the reason ? in 1995 an organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated the world with a pure virus thus wiping o,-1

well here's a distasteful thoroughly amateurish item that surprisingly was actually a box-office hit at the time of its release . after just viewing the film for the first time my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy this movie ? it is cheap idiotic unfunny and not nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was . at least some smut would have livened things up a bit . " porky's " tells the story ( if you can call it that ) of four clueless high school b,-1

the most absurd remake of 1998 ? it's a toss up between gus van sant's psycho and mighty joe young the new disney picture based on the old rko picture . ( i knew i was in trouble when a polished computer-generated version of that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits . ) there is no great demand for another giant ape movie-make that ape movie period .

i think of i know what you did last summer as the movie that scream and scream 2 could have been . mind you though i mean this in the worst possible way . i know what you did last summer is a typical slasher flic without the smarts of the scream's . as a result it's even worse than some of your better campy horror pictures ( see nightmare on elm street ) because it thinks it's about thirty times smarter than it is . based on a teen book of the same name and disappointingly adapted ,-1

i can imagine how good krippendorf's tribe must have looked on paper . it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director ( todd holland ) all wanted to make this film . in fact it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf's tribe as possible . in retrospect i can imagine how bad this film could,-1
after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball . fiercely unoriginal director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him . there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind . the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars . the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13 . interior spacecraft ,-1
 " america's sweethearts " has an intriguing premise and a great cast but it isn't nearly as edgy or funny as it should be . almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting " comic relief " charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence ) . crystal ignores a simple but crucial rule : for a scre,-1
do the folks at disney have no common decency ? they have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects embarrassing writing and kid-friendly slapstick . wasn't mr . magoo enough people ? obviously not . inspector gadget is not what i would call ideal family entertainment . younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt ,-1
if you haven't plunked down your hard-earned money yet for " wild wild west " the latest summer holiday offering from will smith let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbuck's frappacino or on a ben & jerry's sundae . these treats are great relief from the summer heat . in contrast this film made me simmer in disappointment . i can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usu,-1
synopsis : two con artists find the perfect patsy in harry ( woody harrelson ) - - an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post tries to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye has ill-timed fits of coughing and fails at everything he does . the story is told from harry's point of view . harry always carries around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesn't drink . one day harry is approached by the con girl rhea ( elisabeth shue ) who is similar to harry in ,-1
there are scenes in " the big hit " that are so awful they simply defy description . the movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made " last action hero " ( 1993 ) such a chore to sit through . presumably " the big hit " is an action-comedy a difficult but not impossible genre to pull off . movies of this sort require a fine balance and careful tone and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence . " lethal wea,-1
well i guess it's that time of the year again . the one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even * try * writing a script that has more dialogue than explosions . it's also the best time for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies pull on their black vests and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases . in america they call this time " summer " and,-1
the rapid-fire formula that worked so well in airplane ! the " police squad ! " television series top secret ! three naked gun films and two hot shots ! movies has finally reached a desperate dead-end with spy hard . even ezio gregio's the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over-extended spy- and action-movie spoof . leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd-40 who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis general rancor ( a cackling andy griffith ) . the jo,-1
tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance and into a studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi-tiered marketing materials for crap movies . and here he hits rock bottom with planet of the apes . i didn't expect much from this latest " interpretation " of pierre boulle's classic novel planet of the apes . i mean how could you top the force and impact of the original film intelligen,-1
the premise of this movie is well pretty far-fetched . tom berenger plays shale a mercenary who is temporarily out of work ( those fools at the cia have denied his existence just because he and his buddies botched a job in cuba ) . fortunately his girl friend ( diane venora ) a teacher at christopher columbus high school in miami gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student creating a job opening for shale as a substitute teacher . not telling his girl friend who might ob,-1
the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for a secret mission . he attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth but misses . after they ricochet off his face he says " not a good start .

cashing in on the success of white men can't jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles ( including the cowboy way and drop zone ) wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed hoping that they can strike up the same success . sadly if this dismal cliche ridden and mind-numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by they haven't got a chance in hell of even coming close . this time out the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops . following several run-ins with ,-1
back in 1980s chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films . he couldn't of course top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shoot'em up and beat'em up genre aficionados . that quantity was mostly provided by cannon group prolific production company that dominated the b-movie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap formulaic and more ,-1
we could paraphrase michelle pfieffer's character in dangerous minds and say that beyond rangoon starts with an " a . " that's fair enough . all movies like all school children should be given the benefit of the doubt . the chance to succeed . after all we like to think that the right combination of talent and effort can do wonders . mountains can be moved and good movies can be made . yeah right . children fail as do films . as does director john boorman's latest . the succes,-1
i think that saying that the x-files is one of this summer's most anticipated films is safe . for five years " the x-files " television show has developed a dedicated fan culture whose rabid devotion to the series rivals that of " star trek " fans . the premise of both the movie and the television series is two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal ; fox mulder ( david duchovny ) is the avid believer whose quest to find the truth about extraterrestrial life borders on the paranoid an,-1
contrary to popular belief not every single foregin film released to an american market is a masterpiece . some of them aren't even good . some examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful " un indien dans la ville " ( presented as " little indian big city " and remade into that crap tim allen flick " jungle2jungle " ) and this . what could have been a clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick . " french twist " ( the " cool " american title not th,-1
i can see a decent sports movie struggling to break free of oliver stone's `any given sunday' . it's an entertaining movie that offers both insight and excitement into the rock-em sock-em profession of pro football . unfortunately the director seems to have only one priority on his mind : sprucing up the film with an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers . in altering each frame with quick-flash photography and dizzying in-your-face editing stone appears to have completely ignored the ,-1
this well-conceived but ultra sugary coming-of-age film is not for everyone and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion . joseph cross ( joshua beal ) is a 10-year-old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather ( loggia ) to bone marrow cancer . loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup . the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family where everyone is just so nice and ,-1
well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you . because thats all that there really is . . . . i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot . for one thing a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity . . . . i am not saying that this isn't possible . . but it does leave one to wonder . . . i know i did . another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched ou,-1
when a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is to give it a pass . toss out your usual objectivity ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it forget how unbearable it was to sit through and find some meaningless way to compliment it . this of course will be of no service to your readers but at least you'll avoid the hate mai,-1
in this year's summer movie preview issue of _entertainment_weekly_ theresa connelly described her writing-directing debut _polish_wedding_ as " a child that did not quite become the child i thought it would . " one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film a comedy-drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements . the family at the center of _polish_wedding_ is the pzoniaks which consists of mother jadzia ( lena olin ) father bolek ( gabriel byrne ,-1
several days after having seen this movie i'm still trying to determine what director christopher guest a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes . this is a dreadful motion picture ? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio . there's a kind of desperation in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about ,-1
when i was nine i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store . masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures : they combined science fiction and fantasy had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read . of course the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history . given the tremendous success of the toys and the ca,-1
in " gia " angelina jolie plays the titular character the first so-called supermodel . and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome ( in my eyes anyway ) . i just don't see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film . despite this i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie . sadly though my fears were realized . it's just not possible to make an interesting full-length film about a person who spends their days wearing different clot,-1
conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children's items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty-five or thirty years after the item was made . that's when the kids of that time have jobs disposable income and a desire to re-visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives . check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you'll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks . there's a heavy nostalgia nowadays for,-1
the following review encompasses two versions of dune : dune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book . the film's visual splendour mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative . dune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 18,-1
in 1970s many european intellectuals especially those on the left political hemisphere became obsessed with the rise of fascism . which wasn't so hard to expect because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies . in such times when political involvement could be associated with noble passion many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre-war eur,-1
dr dolittle ( 20th century fox ) running time : 1 hour 25 minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the success of the nutty professor ( 1996 ) murphy returns in this abysmal comedy . he plays doctor john dolittle who as a child had the ability to understand animals . however after being 'exorcised' he loses this ability and we fast forward to see dolittle in a crummy job surrounding by crummy people ( most notably dr mark weller played by oliver platt . ),-1
the general's daughter is a heartless absurd film a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters . director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham-handed obscenity creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo-depth . what's worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to ,-1
disney's " air bud " tells a boy-and-his-dog story with a twist -- the pooch is quite an accomplished basketball player . granted for a family comedy it's not a very funny or successful idea to begin with but it doesn't seem to matter -- " air bud " is surprisingly solemn . save for occasional moments of forced slapstick the movie wags its tale with a straight face -- not a very enjoyable approach . if " air bud " had realized its own absurdity then it possibly could have been bette,-1
bad movies described as " a swift descent into sinful pleasure decay and debauchery " are hard to watch . bad 2000's movies that resemble bad 1980s films are even harder to watch . shadow hours falls into the latter category a mish-mashed train wreck of b-movie actors ( including michael dorn aka star trek's worf ) an uninteresting plot vain attempts at capitalizing on the " underground " scenes of seedy los angeles and really really bad directing and horrendous music video-esq,-1
bruce willis needs to stay away from straightforward action pictures . mercury rising adds to a growing list ( including such stinkers as the jackal last man standing striking distance and the last boy scout ) of stale actioners he has headlined . and though mercury rising tries to spice things up by throwing an autistic kid in the mix it is every bit as stale . art jeffries ( bruce willis ) is your typical tormented fbi agent . you know the type haunted by his job yet so good at w,-1
capsule : godawful " comedy " that's amazingly shabby and cut-rate and rather bereft of laughs . i was having a bad week in my life when i saw austin powers : international man of mystery . i desperately needed something to cheer me up or at least distract me so i could get a clear head . get some perspective . even dumb movies can do that for me sometimes . i tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment but i am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks t,-1
battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close . in fact i'll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years . based on the novel by scientology guru l . ron hubbard battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information . it's the year 3000 and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes . ok w,-1
jet li busted onto the american action movie scene when he stole the show in 1998's lethal weapon 4 with his wicked looks his nasty moves and his undeniable charisma . it only took another two years for mega-producer joel silver to set him up in an all-american movie primed to take over some of the empty action-hero seats left by alleged coke-head van damme and that pudgy guy named steven seagal . would this film take li past his rival asian action counterparts namely chow yun-fat an,-1
vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico . the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow ( james woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out . while the initial imagery is a little over-dramatic it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence . that is enough action to last us a while and we could director john carpenter would let us get to a story line . but it is not very long and t,-1
when considering david fincher's latest film " the game " four words come to mind . " don't believe the hype . " this michael douglas vehicle from the director of " seven " isn't nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe . the film draws us in with an intriguing concept ( aided no doubt by the riveting trailer ) where a jaded millionaire ( douglas ) is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy . this isn't simply virtual reality . ,-1
weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg's reliance on formulas _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches . there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics . spielberg's greatest strength as a director is the polished formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story . but for a topic of such weight as combat in t,-1
it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire . usually you had to be an aristocrat - a count such as dracula or karnstein . to qualify you'd have to have a modicum of sophistication so you'd at least look cool - or suave - when biting into some young damsel's throat . but today in our overly politically correct world any scuzzy-looking long-haired unshaven lout or any spiked-haired harridans can put the bite on you . by the same token to be a vampire hunter one,-1
hav plenty as we are told in the beginning and reminded during the film is a true story . life itself is a series of true stories but most are not movie material . as scripted directed and acted by cinematic newcomer christopher scott cherot hav plenty limps along at best . its dialog is so stilted - " you know what they say 'no women ; no cry . ' " - that the actors are content to read the screenplay rather than invest much energy in trying to act it . in the story lee plen,-1
it seems that i've stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch . take payback for example a movie that most people seem to like . however it's horrible schlock straight out of hollywood's vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies . it was written and directed by a guy who should have done better ; however maybe he did do better after all 30 percent of the movie isn't his own . mel gibson that hollywood zombie decided he didn't like the ending and had another ,-1

everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap from the roger corman-grade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad campaign ( the poster is nearly identical to that of star trek vi : the undiscovered country ) . but piller's not-quite-half-baked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrection's failure . i'm about to give the same advice to rick berman and co . as i've given to the financiers of james bond movies : it's time to breathe life into th,-1
this is one of the worst big-screen film experiences i've had for a while . with this film plus `showgirls' and `basic instinct' paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors . his celebrated film `total recall' was ? i admit ? successfully scripted but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws . obviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven the result being that much of the special effects in `st,-1

it happens every year -- the days get longer the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their big-budget blockbusters . this year's crop already seems inferior to that of past summers even 1997's lackluster trio of batman & robin the fifth element and the lost world . the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla ( " heeere lee-zerd lee-zerd . . . " ) which doesn't make me optimistic about future summers . godzilla is of course based on a series of cul,-1
it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part 2 on the day that one of it's stars roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70 . mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood having a career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films . fright night part 2 probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles . this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was . william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both ,-1
the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrian james bond film " the world is not enough " is its final frame : white letters on a black background proclaiming " james bond will return . " oh i certainly hope not . with pierce brosnan in his third and reportedly last go-round as james bond 007 " the world is not enough " is the best example to date that " 'enough " is enough . in this the 19th chapter in the seemingly-endless franchise featuring ian fleming's debonair british,-1
david spade has a snide sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on the tv sitcom just shoot me . it also served as a good showcase for him when he co-starred opposite the late chris farley in tommy boy and black sheep . lost and found marks the comedian's first attempt at going solo in a movie and it also reveals that when spade doesn't have a reliable back-up system his brand of humor seems more desperate than one may expect . david spade is not the problem with lost and foun,-1
sometimes i wonder just what the censors are thinking . take this film " naked killer " among it's ingredients are heavy doses of violence rape sequences straight and lesbian sex scenes and what our system calls " coarse language " . but what do those intelligent people at the censorship bureau choose to remove in case someone will get offended ? one word - penis . that's it . in spite of everything else in the movie the one thing that the censors decide is too much is " penis .

for a film touted as exploring relationships and black sexuality trois is surprisingly tame . despite it's lurid subject matter and it's passing nod to fatal attraction it moves along with flat uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film . freshly moved to atlanta jermaine ( dourdan ) and his wife jasmine ( moore ) have the trappings of a perfect life . they have a beautiful house in su,-1
 " mission to mars " is one of those annoying movies where in the middle of the movie you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because they showcased all the best parts of the movie : all five minutes of it .

" mission " has some good ideas but they get lost in the unbearably boring delivery dime-a-dozen dialogue and spate of good actors wasted in cardboard,-1
my friend here in film school just made a two minute-long film for one of his classes that includes a staged anal rape scene done by two guys and shot on the shadow of the incident with a banana being used as the instrument of penetration . as sick as this all is watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments i've ever witnessed . sure it may be in bad taste but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to th,-1
remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ? " pulp fiction " and " fargo " both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture and not surprisingly a slew of rip-offs followed in the years thereafter . that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing " the way of the gun " that at first glance looks like another of those wanna-be's but upon closer inspection doesn't look like anything comprehendable . it's a ,-1
_dirty_work_ has a premise of deliciously mean-spirited potential . mitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( artie lange ) are losers in life : they were constantly picked on in school and now they cannot hold regular jobs . but as the trailer goes " there is one thing mitch weaver is good at--revenge . " so he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc . this should be t,-1
america's favorite homicidal plaything takes a wicked wife in " bride of chucky " and their unholy matrimony is something old nothing new . the burning question on the minds of most moviegoers however has nothing to do with nuptial specifics or even how the movie stacks up but rather whether or not the duo gets down and dirty on their blood-soaked honeymoon . the answer is a sick-and-twisted yes - and viewers are treated to a shadowy glimpse of some hot-enough-to-melt-rubber ( or at ,-1
this is the first film in what would become the most successful series of horror films of all time . a fair warning to those of you who might be inclined to watch this movie for the first appearance of everyone's favorite goalie-mask-wearing homicidal maniac . jason the guy who single handedly controlled the overpopulation problem around the crystal lake area doesn't start his quest to find the most interesting household item with which to kill someone until the sequel . while he does hav,-1

this is the worst movie i've viewed so far in 98 . the avengers = silly = man dressed in a bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers > evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits + greater evil sir august de wynter wearing kilt . the question is what could have gone wrong with a potentially great idea with big name cast ? the same question was probably asked of last year's stinker batman and robin . i feel the production got a little too smug the script a little to smart and direction wa,-1

wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you . you can see its plot developing from a mile away . you are lured into its benign story of a single 29-year-old girl looking for a soul mate in boston as that city is depicted as a mini-wonderland for singles . this is a star oriented film and the star who carries the film is erin ( hope davis ) . that this is a dating film about singles who for reasons of fate or luck or whatnot have no,-1

if you've been following william fichtner's career ( and there's absolutely no reason why you should have ) you might have noticed that he's played some rather similar roles over the years . like sully in " the perfect storm " --tough gruff and a little bit scary . or law in " albino alligator " --tough gruff and little bit scarier . or colonel william sharp in " armageddon " or dwayne engelman in " strange days " or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of " pearl har,-1

for his directoral debut gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent alcoholic husband and father and the various lives he affects . but while the characters places and events may have special meaning to the writer-director the audience is left in the dark . the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ( ray winstone ) and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him . he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars . ,-1

in 1989 tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather . was it " deep " ? nope . however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up . it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was " without the comic book uplift " of the indiana jones and superman pictures . which was true . if what you,-1

die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco inferior to the original in every respect . place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson who wrote the film's pathetic screenplay . every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor . the plot is altogether implausible ; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to ,-1
when the haunting arrived in theaters all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects . while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department i don't think that they are completely to blame for this movie's failure . it appears that some people have failed to take into account t,-1
plot : set in the future a courier has uploaded some data into a " hard drive " that resides in his head and must now escape the bad guys who are after that very important information . since he overloaded his " hard drive " he's also racing against the clock before the information seeps into his brain and kills him . critique : incoherent boring one-act drivel with no suspense horribly unbelievable futuristic environment bad dialogue career-defining bad acting by keanu reeves ,-1
i am a steven seagal fan . i only say this now because " mufti splenetik " isn't my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things . any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on . seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we'll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) rarely a femal,-1
 " the 13th warrior " comes at the end of as summer where we've already experienced man eating sharks ( " deep blue sea " ) man eating crocodiles ( " lake placid " ) and even a man hunting witch ( " the blair witch project " ) . now " the 13th warrior " presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears . the story if that's what you want to call it follows ahmed ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) an arabian poet who falls in love with his king's wife and is banished fr,-1
it seems like i'm reviewing cheeseball horror movies on a monthly basis now . scream revitalized a genre the studios are now intent on burying into the ground again-the serial killers in these new slasher movies have nothing on sony and miramax in the " relentless " department . i still know what you did last summer is a terrible film in many respects but in the wake of the stupefyingly bad urban legend it's citizen hook . jennifer love-hewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager julie jam,-1
we're back in blade runner territory with this one conceptual artist robert longo's vision of a william gibson-inspired future where information is the commodity to kill for . front and center is johnny ( keanu reeves ) a " cyber-courier " who smuggles data via a " wet-wired " implant . he's ready to quit the biz and get a portion of his long-term memory restored but first he has to finish one last dangerous job . . the pressing problem in johnny mnemonic is that keanu reeves seem,-1
ok i admit it--i find camp amusement with the spice girls . yes the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual " identities " they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of " girl power . " but not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn't enough to carry their big screen debut a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world . the film begins amusingly enough with a cheeky 007-esque title sequence in which the british qui,-1
sylvester stallone has made some crap films in his lifetime but this has got to be one of the worst . a totally dull story that thinks it can use various explosions to make it interesting " the specialist " is about as exciting as an episode of " dragnet " and about as well acted . even some attempts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy script stupid and unlikable characters and just plain nothingness . who knew a big explosion could be so boring and anti-climactic ? unless y,-1
`the skulls' is a laughably bad thriller a teen-orientated doppelganger of `the firm' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor . certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter . i chuckled incessantly all the way home . let me share . the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale ( designed i'm sure to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college ) . luke mcnamara ( jos,-1
it's difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of " award-winning " tv commercials as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes . that said hayes's feature film debut lives up to expectations coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic . but occasionally bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary . those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the film's,-1
bats is this year's camp flick . with the world's worst dialogue cheesiest premise and stupidest editor this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity . as for the rest of us well . . . i'd say skip it but looking at the box office figures for this one it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway . follow their lead and you'll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot . i love alfred hitchcock's the birds almo,-1
starring shawnee smith ; donovan leitch ; ricky paull goldin ; kevin dillon & billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960's classic ( a term that i use very loosely to define the original ) about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way . now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel . the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn't exactly hurt it either . fast forward to the late ',-1
the best thing about " lake placid " is that it's only 80 minutes long and when it's over you're glad that you didn't waste more than an hour and a half of your time . it's nothing more than a bad rip-off of " jaws " ( and i think that's being kind . ) it was written by david e . kelly ( " ally mcbeal " ) as a horror-comedy but fails at both miserably . i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once . the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in " anaconda . " the,-1
that is unless you're one of those people who have seen the preview a thousand times on tv or in the theaters . i can tell you one thing now : they gave the entire movie away . why someone would want to base an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away in the trailers is beyond me . however if they * hadn't * given it away the film would've still been suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject matter . obviously the producers thought they could remake ",-1
director andrew davis reworks his fugitive formula and the results are about as exciting as his last film-- the dreadful comedy steal big steal little-- was funny . keanu " i'd rather play music than play another action hero " reeves is the grad student on the run who along with his superfluous sidekick ( rachel weisz ) has been framed for a sabotaged science experiment that vaporized eight chicago city blocks .

pre-review note : seeing as the only concern of body shots is " sex " i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review . because of this i will try to vary word descriptions of " sex " ( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms and \ or your name is jerry falwell you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen ) so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend fret not it,-1
 " meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood ! " screams the television ads for " hanging up " disastrously written by real-life sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton . make me laugh again ! not only is " hanging up " misadvertised since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two co-stars lisa kudrow and diane keaton little more than extended cameos but they don't actually come together until th,-1
under any other circumstances i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review . however in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful a minute dissection of the ending is necessary . even though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes do proceed at your own risk . the movie opens ( quite poorly i might add ) as child psychologist malcolm crowe ( bruce willis looking like he was dragged out of his tr,-1
brian de palma's snake eyes stars nicolas cage's evil twin who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother . like a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english to ensure that he will be understood cage yells with the ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffeine overload . de palma whose last great film the untouchables was crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic . in snake eyes he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out o,-1
a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets . the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities . the result is merely an academic exercise leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn't build on to show them as the poets they were . on paper this shouldn't have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( " the secret garden " ) a proven screenw,-1
in our time . in our modern world where the cool rule it's hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming 'the man' . and yet - film after film after film is based on his everlasting magic . in warner brothers' latest production shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away . though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet' its title sequence with a frightening rap song an,-1
 " idle hands " is distasteful crass and derivative . if an original thought found its way into this horror-comedy it would die of loneliness . plus you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teen-agers the week after the tragedy in littleton colo . the movie is insulting to horror film fans and teen-agers . the plot what little there is deals with anton ( devon sawa ) ,-1
according to the publicity material with this movie the directors " hope to restore good old-fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness . " hmm . you never know they just might be on to something . what with the rise of geek chic lounge music and seventies fashion the ever-contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own . but then i doubt if kingpin will have ,-1
starring kiefer sutherland ; reese witherspoon & bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen . freeway is giving me second thoughts . freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood . only in the nineties little red riding hood is a foul-mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon and the big bad wolf is a serial killer ( keifer sutherland ) . to top that pathetic premise off -- reese goes to visit granny and you'll never g,-1

what a contrast ! in the space of two days i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly . i'm not sure you could get two more different movies . while the former was all over the top telegraphing everything shoving its philosophy of life down our throats hurlyburly was the complete opposite wound so tight and with so much buried in its script one could spend weeks thinking about it . this is one interesting movie . it's very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of '9,-1
capsule : the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith's films gets their own movie . the gags are sporadically funny . it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes . the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team . the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film . sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the ,-1
the previews for the movie are pretty good . they show a little plot all the characters and the emotional highlights all spliced together to give a general impression of the script . unfortunately the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes . the residents of mystery love hockey . mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football . the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who's guilty of shooting another man ( yes that's one of the movie's ,-1
a suave cool collected rich uptight bad guy = cliche . a clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs = cliche . a bad guy who owns a wild animal = cliche . a crooked chauvinistic law enforcer type = cliche . at an intense moment our main character tries to get away but the car has trouble starting = cliche . complaining about cliches = cliche . ok ok . so we always hear about cliches . but if there was ever to be a prime example the real mccoy is it ! not one uttered word,-1
1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood - two movies dealing with the same subject or to be precise same " high concept " . in summer 1994 that " high concept " was " mad bomber action thriller " . in few weeks " thrillride of the summer " actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes . the movi,-1

it's a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise . the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying . osmosis jones is crude gross disgusting and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind there's something about mary me myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt . not that there's anything wrong with scatology . i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was . it's,-1
has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plot-driven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and a gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs ? in enemy of the state that is exactly right . a few parts the net and a few parts conspiracy theory enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997's lame brained men in black . will this guy ever get a real role ? he has the bruce willis syndrome ,-1

burnt money is the perfect festival film . it will show once or twice and then no one thankfully will ever have to hear from it again . this film from the seattle international film festival 2001's emerging masters series is easily one of the year's worst . billed as a gay `bonnie and clyde' this gritty film from director marcelo pi ? eyro has its only highlight in a well-designed title sequence . two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader whose plan the,-1
claire danes giovanni ribisi and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists but they're just about the only palatable element of the mod squad a lame-brained big-screen version of the 70s tv show . the story has all the originality of a block of wood ( well it would if you could decipher it ) the characters are all blank slates and scott silver's perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come . by sheer force of talent the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from,-1
the haunting a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film : to scare us . if you've ever seen a movie which you probably have considering you are on this website you should know about all of the trivia they post before a movie . they have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film . but the one i always like are the &quot ; other name&quot ; joke that try and rename a particular film . for instance the one playing befo,-1
in 1989 director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama " glory " but since then he has made continuous disappointments to me at least with 1994's " legends of the fall " and 1996's " courage under fire . " those two films weren't bad just not very good but with zwick's latest film " the siege " he has finally made one . " the siege " is a modern-day action-thriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city . investigati,-1

i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year when matthew perry had just signed on . i'm big fan of perry's subtle sense of humor and in addition i think chris farley's on-edge extreme acting was a riot . so naturally when the trailer for " almost heroes " hit theaters i almost jumped up and down . a soda in hand the lights dimming i was ready to be blown away by farley's final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry's big brea,-1
the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride and it's sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the year's finest films . so naturally when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found this notion left me puzzled . it is a rare thing for a children's movie to be praised this highly so wouldn't you t,-1
i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick . take the professional for example . it boasts extremely glossy cinematography a couple of recognizable name actors and a couple of fairly impressive explosions . it's also basically about violence and cheap titilation and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension . the professional is all o,-1
one of these days i'll make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie . king of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding ( and bad lieutenant is only fit for a single emotive viewing ) his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary art-house trappings . it's a perfume-drenched coke-addled visit to the seedy pornography shop where beautiful models ( no hookers -- no courtesans ) usher you through the silk curtains . ferrara's only consistently smart ,-1
making your first feature film ain't easy . assemble a decent if not strong cast as writer/director robert moresco has done with one eyed king and you're already ahead of the game . but rehash old plot lines tired dialogue and standard clich ? s and a well-intentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film . how many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse ? the enormou,-1
whenever u . s . government starts meddling into other countries' affairs under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political religious or ethnic persecution the other side is ready to use mantra that says " look who's talking ! what have you done to the indians ?

 " easely one of the worst films of the year . . " with the millenium just around the corner hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century . this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil . the result is somewhat predictable . i didn't have high hopes about arnold's " much anticipated " return to the big screen . schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased action lovers won't be bored and the catholic league will be angry .,-1
these days people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run . 1970s nostalgia is already wearing off and now people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s . few years in the future early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia . however i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period . one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon's loaded weapo,-1
fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade . tragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies but the quantity . most of those movies were produced by cannon group company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus . those two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman b- movie mentors of future ,-1
everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here . wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence . billy zane is wooden as the hero . kristy swanson is given very little to do and does very little with it . treat williams looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie . only catherine zeta jones as one of williams cohorts turns in a good,-1
how could a g-rated disney film based on meg cabot's novel " the princess diaries " be anything but cute harmless fun ? easy . take all the cute harmless fun out of it . and while you're at it make it borrr-ring . that's what director garry marshall screenwriter gina wendkos and not to be outdone producer whitney houston have done with the g-rated disney film " the princess diaries .

the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence . it's not abhorrent or even blatantly unlikable but it doesn't make a shred of sense . and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ? james foley knows a lot about characters and acting and those are the strengths of the corruptor . but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense and the result is less like a movie,-1

for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking - or what's left of it in mainstream hollywood - movie which are star vehicles are terrible things . as a rule the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor . an actor might be chosen on the up-and-up to give him exposure ; or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck . generally though the actor doesn't matter and sol,-1
i am continually amazed at movies like this . that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on a script as abysmal as this one is mind-boggeling but it seems to happen a lot nowadays . " wild wild west " is a beautifully filmed well acted and well directed piece of garbage ; and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault . in short this movie is a comedy without laughs . so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal . the high production values keep it fr,-1

all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos please raise your hands . thank you for identifying yourselves ; now would you all please go away . your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade and it shows no sign of abating any time soon . it isn't just the strobe light quality of your twenty-cuts-per-minute editing or the numbing over-use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film a,-1

i'm giving this stinker . normally the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be . but the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive helped me come to the big goose egg . i'm not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing or if he was even thinking at all . maybe in mel's little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny . in mine it's not . or maybe,-1
2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off . it basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways . i'm not going into much greater detail than that since it would take forever to explain and quite frankly i'm not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that i've already wasted . while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction 2 days in the valley falls way sho,-1
what would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in a movie ? a better question what would inspire a studio to produce said movie ? if you have an answer let me know . foolish the new movie written by and starring master p is a jaw-droppingly horrible film one with no redeeming value socially cinematically or otherwise . comedically it has some potential but only in its stand-up comedy moments which i can turn on comedy central for . master p stars as fifty d,-1

there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do . i delighted in the sneaky-smart entertainment of ron underwood's big-underground-worm yarn tremors ; i even giggled at last year's critically-savaged big-underwater-snake yarn anaconda . something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth spent in the company of ghidrah the creature from the black lagoon and the blob . deep rising ,-1

writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard . harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun . harder than building a bridge over troubled waters . and incidentally a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review . thrillers are all variations on a theme . you have a smart resourceful and powerful bad guy who has a goal he has to meet . you have a noble and brave good guy who has to protect the innocent kill the bad guy and not get killed himself in the process . ,-1

teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood . every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights wallets in hand . the formula is very simple you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal . you add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in ,-1

" she's all that " has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie i've seen so far this year . and quite frankly i doubt i'll see anything equally bad . ( at least i * hope * i don't see anything equally bad ) . " she's all that " tells the story of the most popular guy in school ( played by freddie prinze jr . ) who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school ( rachel leigh cook ) into the most popular . that right the,-1
michael robbins' hardball is quite the cinematic achievement . in about two hours we get a glancing examination of ghetto life a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy speeches about never giving up a cache of cute kids ( including a fat one with asthma ) a hard-luck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic " big game " where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined . all that's needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have ,-1
in the mid-1980s following the splendid debut in hugh hudson's greystoke and relative success of first highlander film it looked like christopher lambert's acting career might go somewhere . but it wasn't meant to be which became obvious following highlander ii . in this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality . very often such films were science fiction which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade,-1
note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . at the end of the day those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros . made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere . this highly-anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june ope,-1
the first species was a moderately-successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects a few well- paced action sequences and frequent views of model-turned-actress natasha henstridge sans clothing . however it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel . and considering the quality of species 2 it's obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead . the only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is . if you thr,-1
a number of critics have decided that it's open season on freddie prize jr . slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in sound-alike disposable teen fluff like " head over heels " " boys and girls " " down to you " and " she's all that . " while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend his talent is not . i first saw him in the independent dark comedy " the house of yes " where he gave a subtle impressive performance as the younger brother ,-1
everybody in this film's thinking of alicia . no this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the " cryin' " video . this is one of those erotic thrillers but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed . first off there's zero sex almost no nudity and it's not as well-plotted as one of those tweed flicks . well anyway . the " plot . " alicia plays well the babysitter who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents ( j . t . walsh and,-1
the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic . finding an all-star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius . combining all that with a three-time oscar-winning director ( robert benton of " kramer vs . kramer " ) and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment . in yet another noir mystery set in hollywood -- how many of these have we seen during the past ,-1
martial arts master steven seagal ( not to mention director ! ) has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights talks in a hushed tone and squints at any sign of danger . he's also the most consistent individual in hollywood today since all his movies suck . they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art ( that is martial art ) . i'm sure the guy's good and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows alth,-1

_soldier_ is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesn't have jean claude van damme in it . i could liken it to the sci-fi cheese that was the hollywood product-of-choice back in the early 80s but that would be too much of a compliment . if there is a movie theater in hell this film is playing there 24 hours a day . the story such that there is revolves around todd ( kurt russell ) an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be,-1
it's a sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it . such is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film _the last samurai_ . though the blurb alludes to " a jungle filled with political intrigue uneasy alliances and murderous enemies at every turn " the story of the movie is actually quite simple ( and prosaic ) : a middle-aged japanese businessman named endo ( played by john fujioka ) and his assistant both of whom have samurai aspi,-1
birthdays often cause individuals to access their lives . are we doing what we want to be doing ? what happened to our dreams ? with the new millennium our collective big birthday just around the corner some people are sensing a certain dissatisfaction with their existence . the old standbys of traditional religion and science aren't doing it for many anymore and they're looking for something else . we'll be seeing more and more films with a metaphysical theme over the next few years ,-1
the plot of big momma's house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . that's not just the high-concept premise ; it's the fully-realized all-encompassing plot . such an emphasis is not unheard-of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment . one need merely look back to last summer when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent . the trap inherent in such an approach is that the high-concept plot idea better be pretty well-realized or rest o,-1
starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role . not that cindy does that bad it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation . and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy eith,-1

yet another brainless teen flick this one is about surprise drugs and sex . stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldn't look more bored . their characters are cardboard cut-outs of every cliched teenager out there . one thing you need to know is i really hated this movie . everything about it annoyed the hell out of me . the acting and script the plot and ending . the director ( of the fluke hit swingers ) could have very well directed a bunch of no-name actors and had a watcha,-1

 " it was not scary . " these are the first words that came to mind after it was over . when a movie is called _vampires_ " not scary " aren't words that should be associated with it . but that wasn't my only gripe . john carpenter is a name associated with cutting-edge cinema as in the intense scares of _halloween_ _the thing_ and _the prince of darkness_ or the offbeat action of _they live_ and _escape from new york_ . unfortunately the only thing that is cutting edge about _vam,-1

`bats' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan . to pull something like this off you need to have a sense of wit and style with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines . something like the underground worm thriller `tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements and in return the film was tremendous fun . with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player `bats' mainly plays it's premise f,-1
the film may be called mercury rising but that title doesn't describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture a routine thriller that combines government cover-ups with a cloying and poorly-motivated buddy story . the " hook " that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic . however aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient ,-1

recently one night a young director named baz luhrmann couldn't sleep . he tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour . then he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food . then he took down a volume of shakespeare's work and read it cover to cover - never really paying attention to the words or plot . and then as a climax he took out his video camera and pressed the " on " button . the result ? william shak,-1

while watching loser it occurred to me that amy heckerling's true genius as a film-maker is casting . in fast times at ridgemont high she gave us sean penn's jeff spicoli ; in look who's talking she turned bruce willis into a wise-cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival ; in clueless she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is ( or was ) alicia silverstone . she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in sp,-1

in the continuation of warner brother's franchise joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow . what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film . avika goldsman's screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another . this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as " the client " is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fl,-1
long ago films were constructed of strong dialogue original characters memorable plot points and solid acting . one of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is . this opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic and i mean tragic life of novalee nation ( natalie portman ) . hitting the road with her hick guitar-playing boyfriend in a rusted-out gm novalee dreams of the blu,-1

director luis mandoki's last film was the superb serious 1994 drama " when a man loves a woman " but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture " message in a bottle " which is the worst type of romance a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up . everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before---and muc,-1

man this was one wierd movie . similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn't decide which genre it is . the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship . the last half hour ? this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided - " screw it let's just kill everybody " . from then on - forget sci-fi . . . this movie becomes 100% horror . what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried t,-1

movies like six days seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford anne heche and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents . ? the script was written by michael browning and he decided that instead of thinking up new ideas he'd rehash a lot of cliches omit even the slightest bit of character development and then throw in drug-dealing pirates to provide for a few high-level action sequences and explosions . ? there are good s,-1
if anything " stigmata " should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another . of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year it is clearly the worst . i suppose i should have seen this coming . after all " blair witch " thoroughly creeped me out " sixth sense " was mildly spooky and then " stir of echoes " had its moments but wasn't anything i'd lose sleep over . clearly the quality of the horror this summer has slow,-1

films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success whether they're about superheroes ( batman superman spawn ) or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject,1

you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to . in order to make the film a success all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits . no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it's body ( it's basically a complete re-shoot of the shop around the corner only adding a few modern twists ) . essentially it goes against and defies all concepts of go,1
 " jaws " is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . the movie opens with blackness and only distant alien-like underwater sounds . then it comes the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score . dah-dum . from there director steven spielberg wastes no time taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean ,1
moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you've got to know how to allocate your resources . every dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers . in the nfl this leads to teams like the detroit lions who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract but can only field five guys named herb to block for him . in the movies you end up with films like ,1

after watching " rat race " last week i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that when not laughing aloud i had held a grin for virtually all of the film's 112 minutes . saturday night i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn't enjoy it as much the second time as the first . " rat race " is a great goofy delight a dandy mix of energetic performances inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness . hands down this is the most fun film of the summer . ,1
i've noticed something lately that i've never thought of before . pseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films . have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed then when you look back you realize there was something missing ? more and more filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience you may just discover nothing more,1

the ultimate match up between good and evil " the untouchables " is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . based on the 1959 television show of the same title " the untouchables " may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences some excellent acting a memorable score and a clever script . the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where ,1

one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction . the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy innocent fun . sometimes the stories are compelling . sometimes they're not . but with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions . star trek : insurrection is no exception . the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a fri,1
when bulworth ended i allowed myself a sigh of relief : ? it is possible for me to enjoy political satire . ? there have been several recent political films that didn't do a whole lot for me -- wag the dog for instance i found to be an intelligent but heartless film while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness . ? bulworth is a far better film than these both in its execution and lasting impression . ? it's a tremendously funny and intelligent picture but it,1
call 911 for the cliche police if you must but the eyes are the window to the soul . the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman ralph fiennes anthony hopkins morgan freeman . you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds that the characters they play are real human beings . we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great,1
hilarious ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian o'halloran and jeff anderson ) . they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self-fulfillment . the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get-out but you could spend ten times the film's budget ( a reported $27 000 ) and still not get dialogue half as good as this . origina,1

the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler kinder ages . martin scorsese another italoamerican moviemaker confronted that perspective with his own more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets movie that dealt with lower echelons of,1
seen may 31 1999 on home video ( rented ) . one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise . with some films it might be just a secondary issue but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beauti,1

as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell there is a wonderful eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film . the shot has tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars . to see these bars blocking his face we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film . as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bi,1
in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance . ever since wall street douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's . in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world . you'd thi,1
unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi an artist whose palette is fabric . ostensibly the film is a documentary but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . many scenes appear staged and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . the cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . director douglas keeve,1
the event of events is upon us . people have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . i don't think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . anyone who tells you " it's just a movie " is either lying or clueless . it is clearly obvious that aft,1
sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest . some people call it " original " or " artsy " or " abstract " . some people simply call it " trash " . a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings . definitely a generation-x aimed movie a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke-based musical dream sequence . whew ! anyone in their 30's or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film . ,1

will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius . for a movie character that's usually a death sentence . it's a trait associated with what my brother calls " too good for this world " movies like phenomenon or powder . forgive me for spoiling the ending but will doesn't die . this is no formula movie . in fact it's quite fresh and original . it's a character study more than anything and that's not surprising considering it was written by two actors : damon and co-star ben affl,1
if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . so when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along wrap,1

at first glance it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds . that's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) . but home alone actually has a lot going for it and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way . the mcalisters all 15 of them are going to france for the holidays . four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse .,1
when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image . when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars we see constellations meteor showers and cool space-ships . when han solo goes light speed the stars change to bright lines going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point . cool . _october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot traveling horizontally across t,1

national lampoon's animal house made in 1978 and set in 1962 remains one of the -- no fuck that noise -- * the * funniest movie ever made . and this isn't just my opinion either ; everybody knows this and that's why about a gazillion inferior rip-offs have been made trying to duplicate its success .

up until about a year ago john travolta's career consisted of those " look who's talking " movies ( notice how they never called them look who's talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) . but somewhere along the line travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again . weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again whi,1

the computer-animated comedy " shrek " is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups . for children it offers imaginative visuals appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) . for adults it's a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids ,1

hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death ( no pun intended - honest ) . it's a shame too because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b-movie monsters . i mean come on . are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ? hell no . and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well not commonly,1
close your eyes for a moment if you will and imagine the sound of stephen rea's gaelic brogue silky smooth and irish like a pint of guinness . a lackadaisical naughty little schoolboy voice that flirts and gambols . an acerbic sing-song metered voice that evokes the startling imagery and language of anthony burgess' " a clockwork orange .

blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood's premier leading men . blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it . it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well . although at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie . the ideas behind blade are good as is the basic plot of the story . but at times things s,1
no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan's harrowing humorous horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe's novel about young lad francie brady's ( eamonn owens ) descent into madness in 1960s ireland . on one hand it was difficult for me to become invested in francie's story because he is such an unsavory character unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) . on another hand i found it difficul,1
since 1990 the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . now instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow . this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times as 1993's schindler's list shows . most of today's mainstream drama however creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience . that's why pictures like october sky which are ,1
a big surprise to me . the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope . they replaced him just fine . not with john goodman he didn't do much of anything but with the brilliant actor joe morton who can really sing . the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant who's ten . this was another of my fears for the film but he's a really good dancer and plays,1
after having heard so many critics describe " return to me " as an old-fashioned hollywood romance i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ? what made " return to me " old-fashioned and old-hollywood ? was it the tunes from sinatra etc . legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ? was it the glamorous sophisticated feel ? the charisma of the two leads ? even now i can't say that i have gotten any clos,1

many people dislike french films for their lack of closure . while possibly shallow i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany or at least a resolution in the films which i view . there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist stephane ( daniel auteuil ) . stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker . he is passionless about all that which surro,1

 " footloose " has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics . and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it . the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) . he ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do . as mentioned at the beginning of this review " footloose " ,1

 " crazy/beautiful " suffers from the damned-if-you-do damned-if-you-don't syndrome . after a spate of flighty cookie-cutter teen films the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story . but rather than applaud the production early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown " afterschool special .

call it touched by a demon . gregory hoblit's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual horrific twist . if marketed properly this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . in fact there's even a little twin peaks to be found here albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out .

on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his " giallo " murder mysteries . while it's certainly not perfect repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted an,1

is evil dead ii a bad movie ? it's full of terrible acting pointless violence and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release . explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult . `well what's it about ?

i'm not quite sure how best to go about writing this review . i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson's political satire " wag the dog " but in retrospect this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it . quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through and it didn't do that . they also led me to believe that it would de,1
it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child ? whether that may be in life or in death . after having said that i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well . one gets that choking sensation in the throat ( because of grief ) when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement . there is no ocean no drownings and it does not conjure up,1
i know that " funnest " isn't a word . " fun " is a noun and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . but that's the word that came to me right after viewing " chicken run .

just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski change the actors take away the bowling alley add a record store and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) . either way it's been done before a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances yet it remains consistently funny . why is this ? maybe because you know your life is much better than this you,1
plot : a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes . he is taken prisoner along with some other humans and tries his best to escape his simian captors . oh yeah and did i mention that the apes can talk ? kewl ! critique : despite this film not looking like a " tim burton movie " or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun summer f,1
disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched . to see a disaster film with actual originality or at least a decent plot twist would definitely be a welcome surprise . unfortunately folks it's not likely . dante's peak is cliched and at times corny but also pretty decent . to be honest i wasn't very interested in seeing this film and word of mouth as well as several reviews didn't make it sound promising . so i was pleasantly surprised that to fin,1
in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers . full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture . go see it ! so i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on " hard copy " with pam smart the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's . " hard copy " 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of,1
i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool . i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage grousing to myself about its transparently planes trains and automobiles plot machinations and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement . this was a mass market romantic comedy after all a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and even in its best days worked hard to perpetuate,1

mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv-show er . her mast famous episode " love's labour lost " dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child . the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing . there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood's big blockbuster movies . so it's only natural that led,1
i have to say it . tim burton's retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys . ok that's off my chest . no more monkey puns i promise . seriously though planet of the apes is one rip-roarin' summer outing filled with thrills action adventure wit and bits of funny ( dare i say monkey ) business . i know i know i promised . and for those film buffs who are fond of the original burton's version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie . ,1
urban legend surprised me . based on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena . thankfully legend rose above it's soggy premise to become not only a hip scary and stylish entertainment but also what will probably become,1
capsule : the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multi-day festivities . mira nair's film is pleasant enough with a little human drama a few family secrets some sadness and some happiness . you have seen it all before but perhaps not from india . the photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable . low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala . her newest film written by sabrina dhawan is ,1
no i did not read the novel by thomas hardy " jude the obscure " his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life . but after watching the movie i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is . " jude " is a satirical film from start to finish about society's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system but what's r,1

it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters . his new film the thin red line is a strange beautiful enigmatic mess of a movie . the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast . it is filled with above-the-title stars . the cast for the most part gives great performances . john travolta whose role is nothing more than a cameo seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve . george cloo,1
 " stuart little " is one of the best family films to come out this year . it's a cute funny and very good-natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords . though i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about i do know that this film does not disappoint . finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be with a few surprising twists some very funny moments and a few sentimental moments a,1
as with his other stateside releases jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle mr . nice guy is contrived blockheaded and lacking in narrative logic . but also like those other films it is a highly enjoyable ride . once again chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie with no last name . this jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . of course ,1

the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now : " it mu5t be found . " so what exactly is the fifth element ? after seeing luc besson's ambitious much-shrouded-in-secrecy science fiction fantasy i could not help but be let down by the actual answer which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think . but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science f,1
 " very bad things " is the most delightfully morbid film of the year a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn't help but be won over by the material . the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas . the groom-to-be is kyle fisher ( jon favreau ) who is about to be married to the controlling wedding-obsessed laura ( cameron diaz ) . the other friends are real estate agent ,1
known as the most successful highest-grossing romantic comedy in history director garry marshall apparently struck gold with " pretty woman " which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but thanks to positive word-of-mouth was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone . the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film's two charismatic stars richard gere and julia roberts since the story itself is none too original or even believable . the other ,1

near the end of 1996 analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king . the following year 1997 saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia . at best that's all it was -- a sleeper hit designed to surprise but not shake the industry . in 1998 however things have been decidedly different . there hav,1
capsule : a rock and roll fable indeed . like a hubert selby jr . novel filtered through equal parts damon runyan and bruce springsteen and a ton of fun . streets of fire bills itself as " a rock and roll fable " and the description is perfect . this is a stylish great-looking and breezily enjoyable movie that feels like a hubert selby jr . novel with a damon runyan rewrite irected by bruce springsteen . noir is one of the few truly american movie genres aside from the ho,1

with more and more television shows having gay characters and even the infamous " ellen " sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines . the birdcage was critically acclaimed as was this years chasing amy . then along came in & out and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released . it's also noticeable that this " alternative lifestyle " becomes less and ,1
with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there and his latest hearts in atlantis is no different . its structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books . the parallels don't end there either . atlantis was adapted by william goldman,1
corey yuen's latest film " hero " is notable on two fronts . first this is the film to bring back the shaw brothers studio back to the forefront of film production . secondly the film is the re-discovery of yuen biao . the film opens around the end of the qin dynasty when many immigrants were making their way to shanghai . poverty and crime rule most of china . a young man ma wing jing and his brother enter the fabled city and become laborers at the pier . tam see is the most power,1
note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . on december 20 1996 amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream . although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns eventually topping $100 million domes,1
note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . it's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth . the lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdi,1
in intolerance d . w . griffith told four different historical stories at the same time cutting from one to the other . each of the stories builds to a fast-paced climax . in magnolia paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others . yet the stories and where they are going are all independent . what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized . each story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a t,1
contact is the 1997 movie i've seen the most - five times to be exact . four of those times were on the big screen but even on a tv it's a very impressive film . the same can't be said for films like independance day but that's because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects and all of us know looking back that id4 didn't offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy . contact's wonderfully presente,1
roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton . this italian film star best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust . but benigni's life is beautiful ( la vita e bella ) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love devotion and sacrifice . the movie starts out as a ty,1
larry flynt is a self proclaimed smut pedlar and the owner/publisher of the multi-million dollar hustler publications company . the people vs . larry flynt is the story of larry flynt's fight for the freedom to circulate and sell his pornographic magazine hustler . based on a true story the film is almost a documentary in that it's a very vivid and detailed look at larry flynt's life . woody harrelson gives an excellent performance . he conveys flynt's peculiarities and his character wit,1
virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre . since 'dark city' ( 1998 ) films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another . the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix . all the films released after it have been less successful . david cronenberg's existenz released only a couple of months after the matrix was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) but the hype was gone . and when 'the thirteenth flo,1
i don't know what movie the critics saw but it wasn't this one . the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring . in my personal opinion they couldn't be more wrong . if you were expecting airplane ! -like laughs and agatha christie-intense mystery then yes this movie would be a disappointment . however if you're just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time this is one to see . honest it is . this story is about a 4t,1
it was with great trepidation that i approached +mary+ the farrelly brothers+ latest film . i knew the film would be funny--the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see . but i also knew the film would be an equal-opportunity offender attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon . i figured the film would be raunchy maybe another lucky escapee from nc-17 hell . i may laugh but would i feel better in the morning ? i needn+,1
with stars like sigourney weaver ( " alien " trilogy ) and academy award winner holly hunter ( the piano raising arizona etc . ) together in a single hollywood production one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot . sadly for copycat though tightly scripted and nicely plot is still at heart a typical hollywood thriller . helen ( weaver ) after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer darryl ( harry connick jr . ) has developed a,1
no it is not a bad film in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly . event horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film i'm sure many who have watched this will agree with me . it is not even original in that sense and it does borrow heavily from films like alien hellraiser and even blade runner . the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying . the stor,1
a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! i didn't really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family . the movie bombed at the box office and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based . my real concern though was the general reputation of snl-related movies translating to the big screen with less-than-stellar results ( half-baked anyone ? ) i was surprised to discover a truly entertaining often hilarious ye,1
no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan . i'm referring specifically to the narrative form . in the sweet hereafter egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster . said story of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent british columbia that shatters the morale of the locals is told in a most unstraightforward manner . when the film opens the accident has already happened and stephens ( the wonderful holm ) a,1

i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater on a sunday afternoon . when the movie was over and the audience was exiting i didn't hear one negative comment and i didn't have any to offer . simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys simon ( ian michael smith ) and joe ( joseph mazzello ) and what destiny holds for both of them . simon is a dwarf who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart . surprisingly he d,1
the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be in some ways . in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint and its series sequel the return of the saint val kilmer plays simon templar an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others . this movie closely resembles a james bond flick . it has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it a woman whom the man persues a villain out to ,1
plot : jet li is a chinese cop asked to help some french policemen nab a bad guy . but one thing leads to another and the next thing you know li's being chased by the same french cops with whom he was supposed to be working . a lot of ass-kicking face-whippings gun fights and . . . okay a little more ass-kicking ensues . critique : very cool ! now here's a movie that gives you exactly what you're looking for if what you're looking for is kickass action a palpable good cop/bad c,1
weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple powerful films the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) among them . in the truman show weir essentially breathes life into the now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from the inside-out . it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character truman burbank . by now you must,1
synopsis : it's 1977 in a small italian american neighborhood in new york . disco music is popular and the sexual revolution is on but the people of new york are not happy . in fact they're terrified . as in spike lee's do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip and peoples' tempers are flaring . the cool of night offers no respite : the neighborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the son of sam . no one knows who the son of sam is,1
i must admit i'm going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend . the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity . i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre but something drew me to this film . maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role and the hilarious eugene levy .,1
jay and silent bob strike back kevin smith's swan song to his two most famous characters is the best received comedy that i've seen since there's something about mary which is a tea party in comparison to the foul-mouthed humor in jay and silent bob strike back . the audience didn't just laugh ; they went wild with boisterous laughter and heavy applause throughout . in short if you like really raunchy humor you may find it as i did to be the funniest movie of the year . ( on th,1
damn those trailers . had it not been for the advertising of this film which reveals far too much about its contents i would have been glued to `under the sand' . as it is the film retains some value thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling and a more mature francois ozon in the director's chair . marie ( charlotte rampling ) and her husband jean ( bruno cremer ) lounge on the beach . she takes a nap while he goes for a swim . when marie wakes up jean is nowhere ,1
bob the happy bastard's quickie review : rush hour so what's the problem with 48 hours clones these days ? they always try for the same thing that eddie murphy and nick nolte had . that was the problem that plagued these clones not to mention the actual sequel : another 48 hours a complete waste of film . but at last someone has a different take on the matter and it's director brett rainer . rush hour features jackie chan in his first u . s . action movie playing a chinese dete,1
this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city of james cameron's most heralded film titanic . postponed from last summer with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history this was one film i was eager to preview . so is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ? my best guess . . . . it will sink though with many awards attatched to its hull . no doubt titanic is the most elabo,1
whew . this film oozes energy the kind of breakneck no- holds-barred in-your-face risk-taking filmmaking that is seldom seen on screen these days . like the marginal motley bunch of post-apocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries to depict trainspotting veers on the edge of utter mayhem but ultimately retains its footing and control . the result : a movie that is a delightful example of how the medium is the message . the message : a bunch of losers with loser names mark renton,1
he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother . she inspires his love and his fear and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus . he has a rudimentary grasp of language mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother's phrases . he is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous ; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door . he is 35-years-old in body but a child in mind and spi,1
when i first heard of contact the hype was building it up as a sci-fi blockbuster . now with that in mind coupled with the knowledge of jodie foster's involvement in the project i thought " what in the world is foster doing in a sci-fi blockbuster ? ? ? " . as it turned out my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsy-turvy . robert zemeckis back from the euphoria created by his last film forrest gump once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure wit,1
you've got to love disney . no matter what they serve up it is a guaranteed success as long as it's animated . kids have to go see the movie . then they have to get the toys . oh the video came out ? got to buy it or risk little billy's temper tantrums for the next month . all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom . stay at the disneyland hotel ! buy a disney t-shirt ! eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick ! it's,1

i hate to burst your bubble but after all the star power mega bucks screenwriters directors and cool trailers men in black is not the best movie of the summer . it's pretty good in it's own right yes but i would probably split the " best movie " honors among face/off spawn con air and maybe event horizon . it's main problem is that it's quickly forgettable and i can't remember one truly good scene from it . from con air it was the scene out in the desert when they we,1
i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan . i've seen some of his films ( silkwood backdraft unlawful entry ) and while he gave adequate performances i have never been impressed with his work . breakdown then is something of a surprise . russell gives a fine performance as do most of the cast one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film . to say that he holds the film together would not be completely true ,1
with the success of the surprise hit alien directed by ridley scott a sequel was inevitable . in fact after watching the first film a sequel was wanted particularly by this reviewer . handing over the director's chair to recent box office gem james cameron who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii a surprisingly dull film and terminator making cameron a household name ) the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions . instead of being a suspens,1
in one of my many videos i have attained from the local library casablanca was my third classic in some weeks . the others being citizen kane and vertigo ( yes i am trying to see as many of afi's greatest movies ever made as i can ) . but casablanca stood out from the rest for me : it was actually watchable . what most hail as the greatest american film ever casablanca isn't so much a love story as a political frenzy with a love triangle thrown in . it seems that star humphry bogart ,1

susan granger's review of " big eden " ( jour de fete ) it's utopia this tiny town tucked away in the timberland of northwestern montana where old codgers lounge on the porch of the general store to pass the time away and the local matchmakers ( nan martin louise fletcher ) eagerly pair off the young people regardless of sexual preference . there's nary a homophobe or bigot around much to the surprise of henry hart ( arye gross ) a successful but lonely manhattan artist who returns,1
when you go to the movies as much as i do you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times . such was the case with frequency . every time i went to a screening there was the frequency preview . it looked awful . it looked cheesy sappy and ridiculous . it looked like a flop . well whoever put that trailer together should be fired because in terms of pure entertainment frequency is one of the best of the year thus far . frequency boasts a compelling sto,1
it must be tough to be a mob boss . just ask paul vitti ( robert deniro ) a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing . i can believe it too - one can't even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when he's forced to choose between an ice pick baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with . suffering from reoccurring panic attacks paul decides he needs to consult some professional help . and who better than billy crystal . after appearing in bot,1
expand the final fifteen minutes of home alone into a feature-length film and you've got baby's day out--an agreeably amusing children's comedy about a bumbling band of kid kidnappers who are unwittingly outwitted by an innocent infant . the plot tracks a trio of crooks-posed-as-photographers ( mantegna pantoliano haley ) who steal nine-month-old bennington august cottwell iv aka baby bink from his old-money home . but the plan goes awry when baby crawls out an open window and into the,1
in 1977 something never though possible happened . the film star wars was released with extraordinary never seen before techniques of special effects . the film set a new standard for special effects in film . not only did it set a standard for the special effects it set a standard for film itself . the plot is one of the most creative i heard ever . the legend of star wars starts long ago with the jedi . the jedi were warriors who were wiped out by the dark side . darth vader is ,1
i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night . i went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success : personal growth and insightful humor about life . i came away somewhat disappointed in this regard getting some of the latter and not much of the former . the basic plot revolves around billy crystal who plays mitch robbins turning forty . he's now become the station manager of the radio station in whi,1

well i'll admit when i first heard about this film ( which was before dante's peak ) i could just smell what 'twister' had started . so now it seems that we're in a full fledged return to the '70's disaster film era . with 'twister' 'dante's peak' 'volcano' and soon 'flood' and james cameron's extremly expensive 'titanic' i'll say first off i enjoyed 'volcano' much more than i did 'dantes peak' . part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears,1
 " last night " could have an " aka " tagged on the end of it that says " it's the end of the world and we feel fine " . " last night " is about just that . the last night of planet earth's existence . the world is going to end at precisely midnight january 1st 2000 . how scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained . nor is the event itself . throughout the entire movie no explanation is given as to why this is happen,1
 " a bug's life " may not be " toy story " but it's more close than " antz " was . i really liked " antz " basically because yes it is clever and witty and intelligent ( and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead perhaps the year's most inspired casting ) but there was in fact something missing from it and i'm the first to admit that . maybe it's that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun - it's too obsessed with its orwel,1
near the end of frank capra's holiday classic its a wonderful life george bailey ( jimmy stewart ) is feeling down . he has devoted his life to others and never fulfilled his dream of leaving his small supburb town bedford falls . standing upon a bridge above stormy waters he looks down contemplating suicide . he has potential he hasn't fulfilled -- yet he has done so much for others . as a young chap his ambition was to leave his hometown of bedford falls . but times and am,1
jerry springer has got nothing on " wild things . " john mcnaughton's new thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less than two hours than springer's notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks -- bisexuality threesomes poolside catfights slutty rich bimbos even redneck gator-wrestling they're all part of the movie's raucous complex storyline . but even trash tv topicality can't drag " wild things " down -- this crazy campfest plays like something you'd find late-night on t,1
the happy bastard's 30-second review big daddy happy gilmore as a father ? of course ! that's the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy a movie that's passable but isn't really considered some of sandler's best work . he doesn't actually play happy gilmore in the movie but a variation of him . he's sonny coufax a man who's living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his one-day-a-week gig as a tollbooth man ( tollbooth willie ? ) ,1
 " six days seven nights " is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare . here's a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it's fluff recognizes it's fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff . of course the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie's success ; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor tha,1
the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king's work . this slow-moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals but suffers from a tepid conclusion inconsistent direction and may not have wide commercial appeal . when the maid dolores claiborne is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer it seems like an op,1
seen september 13 1998 at 4 p . m at rotterdam square mall cinema 6 theater #2 with chris wessell for free using my sony/loews critic's pass . [theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats average sound picture unstable] " rounders " is exactly the kind of movie parents don't want their kids to see . it's not that it's a drunken orgy of sex and violence but because it's a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling . and to take make things " worse " it proves this th,1
there was a lot riding on this movie . everyone even moderately interested in the " scream " series was dying to know how it would end . what would be the " final act " ? this is the end of an era for them a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies and for kids under 17 those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into " scream " while narrowly escapin,1
although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama 'the sopranos ' analyze this is witty and entertaining enough to be a good movie in it's own right . billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol who new 'patient' happens to be gangster boss paul vitti ( de niro . ) ben wants nothing to do with vitti as he's about to get married to laura macnamara ( kudrow ) and having a gangster as a patient wouldn't really help . but ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds ,1
 " being john malkovich " is the type of film we need to see more . today's films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas or those that have similar themes . malkovich falls under none of these categories and it's quite refreshing to see that occur . this strangely provoking story is actually somewhat understandable . john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time . his wife ( cameron diaz ) supports the both of them by working at a petstore ,1
as feel-good formulaic as it may be in its own way shall we dance ? also demonstrates a kind of charming restraint you don't often find in american films . this japanese import tells the story of a middle-aged accountant named sugiyama ( koji yakusho ) whose mundane life is shaken up one night when he spots beautiful mai kishikawa ( tamiyo kusakari ) in the window of a dance school . intrigued by her melancholy demeanor ( and slightly infatuated with her ) sugiyama signs up for weekly cla,1
 " the tailor of panama " is a different kind of spy movie . despite the presence of pierce brosnan there is nary a hint of james bond flash here . instead of big action scenes leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation . based on the novel by john le carr ? who also co-wrote the screenplay the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid well-told story . brosnan plays andy ,1
upon arriving at the theater during the opening credits i took my seat and prepared myself for what appeared to be " hellraiser meets the crow " . but as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue describing " the strangers " and their reasons for contacting human beings i was hooked . there was something especially compelling about the nature of his voice . i knew from the start that i was going to witness the actions of his character rather than the actor attempt,1
kadosh means sacred in hebrew . amos gitai's fictional work after spending most of his career doing documentaries is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage even though the marriage is a loving one . the marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli's modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic's intolerable one as both groups are vying for control of the secular government . gitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor par,1
the film " magnolia " can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests . the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower . they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart . the numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially . from a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host each one of these char,1
no humans were harmed tested or tasted in the making of this film . all recipes are fictions . twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism . a psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul ! director/writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves . .

curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy but its humour won't appeal to everyone . to be specific let me give you an example . do you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated ? if you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny don't see curdled . on the other hand if you found that sequence to be pretty funny you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at . our film's heroine ga,1
most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen or you hate his guts . my family for the most part hates him and his movies . i think he's very funny but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years . so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of . unrestrained by physical boundaries allen's humor comes shining through . those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the res,1
that's the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into " the wedding singer " the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus . does he draw laughs from his sad puppy dog expression and don't-hate-me-for-being-a-simpleton observations ? or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people ? or is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over ? well there's a little bit of all of that in " the wedding singer " and while ,1
jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box-sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well-off . maybe it's a classic case of displacement : it's easier to see jarvis' own lyrics ( obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall ) as a fetishization of lowlife rather than leigh's films . but it's worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working-class character,1
richard linklater's " slacker " made in 1991 for a budget of only $23 000 immerses itself in the twentysomething college-town culture of austin texas . most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning . their lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation ; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democrac,1
 " a breed apart " casts rutger hauer as a crazy bird-loving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner . a bit hard to swallow ? that's only the first of many improbabilities in this film . hauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds on his island safe while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector . turner is the woman caught between the two men . " a breed apart " isn't a bad movie exactly . indeed i found ,1
titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it's upsetting that it isn't . the film which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it 'sunk' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron who wrote and directed the film . we all know that big budget dosen't mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic . but sadly titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although ,1
one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length . if a film is only 90 minutes but feels like 300 minutes then it's crap . but if a film last 2 1/2 hours and feels like 90 minutes then it's excellent . boogie nights falls into the latter catagory . the director anderson delivers a funny hip yet sometimes violent film which flies along . mark whalberg a . k . a marky mark plays eddie adams a seventeen year old with a certain 'gift' in the midriff area . ,1
it's ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director's cut of the film . films such as aliens the abyss the wild bunch blade runner and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker's integrity later chopped up or mucked with by the studio . the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of su,1
while it was part of former yugoslavia my country croatia used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general . words " croatia " and " croatians " were unheard even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations . the rare exception was the dogs of war 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth's bestselling novel yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context . in a single line they are referr,1
this is a film about secrets some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl frances boyd ( ashley ) . others that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple geoffrey gaines ( stephen ramsey ) the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field and his artist wife lillian ( miriam h,1
you may not have heard of lucas or if you have you might not think much of it . probably because it stars corey haim or maybe because it's about a little geek who collects insects or maybe because it doesn't feature slick one-liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80's . however you have been missing out on a true masterpeice the best film of 1986 and the best film about adolescent life ever made . corey haim stars as l,1
in arguably the most anticipated movie this century george lucas has achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster . despite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence in the sound and special effects department . in terms of characters by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) whose mature performance far exceeds her tender 14 years of age . she,1

i know that " funnest " isn't a word . " fun " is a noun and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . but that's the word that came to me right after viewing " chicken run . " no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions like " that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! " so to hell with webster's -- " chicken run " is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while . i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner . the chickens at,1
after the press screening of " moulin rouge " i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues . everyone seemed a bit numb understandable after sitting through a barrage of often-incongruous sounds and images . a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it . another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production while a woman who flat-out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye . when,1
 " living out loud " is the type of motion picture we don't often see : it is a film about mature intelligent adults instead of the usual american film in which children basically dress up in grown-up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven-year-olds . judith ( holly hunter ) a fortysomething living in new york city has been having a difficult time with life lately . she is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband ( martin donovan ) who had been c,1

written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) directed by robert altman some time ago a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel . the novel was a summer smash topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads . the only problem : the novel wasn't very good . it was far more pulp than pulitzer . but the director realized that no matter how ,1
october sky is a rare oddity in cinema : a self-proclaimed " uplifting " film that is actually uplifting ! based on the autobiographical book by homer hickam rocket boys october sky tells the struggle of four boys reaching for their dream . it's 1957 and for the boys of coalwood west virginia there's not much hope of a rosy future . coalwood is a coal mining town and except for the few lucky ones who manage to escape on a football scholarship most of coalwood's boys are destin,1
this three hour movie opens up with a view of singer/guitar player/musician/composer frank zappa rehearsing with his fellow band members . all the rest displays a compilation of footage mostly from the concert at the palladium in new york city halloween 1979 . other footage shows backstage foolishness and amazing clay animation by bruce bickford . the performance of " titties and beer " played in this movie is very entertaining with drummer terry bozzio supplying the voice of the devi,1
while watching boiler room i was constantly reminded of last year's masterpiece fight club . both films consist of a predominately male cast . both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires . and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped . while boiler room writer/director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club he does co,1
written by mark rosenthal and lawrence konner starring charlize theron bill paxton david paymer as reviewed by james brundage i'm beginning to get fed up . over my four years as a critic the thing which has kept me going is the moderate balance of films . the good balances the bad . i try to see both in equal proportions . but disney's mighty joe young remake marks the fourth week in which i haven't seen a truly terrible movie . it's a backwards machismo i suppose the urge to s,1
notting hill's trailer is awful : a laughless schmaltzy montage . the movie was desperately marketed to the anti-phantom menace crowd the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter . and it apparently worked . perhaps the presence of julia roberts-whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me-had a lot to do with notting hill's opening weekend success but the film's staying power is based on word of mouth . allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill . gr,1

slavery is bad . after hundreds of years we've finally figured that one out . this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg's latest " serious " film . during the late 1830s a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa's west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery . fifty-three of them are stuffed into the " la amistad " ( from a spanish word for " friendship " ) by their new spanish ow,1
reflecting on " bedazzled " a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser one sinful thought remains in my mind . if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley ( who portrays the fiery demon ) then use that pitchfork and point me the way . with her pouty lips irresistible british accent and wild display of haute couture hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation . it's practically impossible to turn th,1

since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller " blood simple " joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic original and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood . their films are highly stylized deeply embedded in a particular time and place and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances . in " the big lebowski " their first cinematic offering since the multiple acade,1
lean mean escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by . most are unnecessarily complicated and others have no sense of expediency -- the thrill-ride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot . perhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive which featured none of the flash-bang effects of today's market but rather a bread-and-butter textbook example of what a clever script and good direction is all about . the latest tony scott movie enemy of the state doesn't make i,1

1992's alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) but in many ways the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments 1979's alien and 1986's aliens savaged david fincher's slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . hence weaver director jean-pierre jeunet and the others behind alien resurrection faced a,1
it is simply amazing how " the green mile " developed in its three hour running time . based on the stephen king series of the same title the film starts out painfully slow with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue . however as the plot begins to progress the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction . frank darabont who masterfully followed a prisoner's story in " the shawshank redemption " this time follows the perspective of,1
the jekyll and hyde story told from his maid's point of view is in a word " dark " . you wouldn't expect something bright and cheery based on robert louis stevenson's novel but the film is surprisingly dreary and dismal . jekyll/hyde ( john malkovich ) is terminally depressed and desperate . mary reilly ( julia roberts ) is a victim of monstrous child abuse and the anti-woman sentiment of the times . director stephen fears' version of the london slums makes us marvel that anyone surviv,1

gothic murder-mystery yarns are not a new conceit . in fact they've been around in books and on film for many many years . without the proper handling they come off as old-fashioned bland and outdated .

one of the best things about my job is that every so often a film still catches me by surprise .

in essence good will hunting is an ordinary story told well . taken as a whole there's little that's special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path leaves the audience with a warm fuzzy feeling and never really challenges or surprises us . but it's intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) strongly directed and nicely acted . so while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece it's a worthwhile sample of entertainme,1
clue is an unfairly ignored comedy very similar to 1976's murder by death . this big screen version of the classic board game ( what's next . . . chutes and ladders : the motion picture ? ) is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue . the plot for what it's worth has all the characters from the game ( in this case the names from the game are used as aliases ) meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr . boddy ( lee ving ) the man who's been blackmailing them all . when h,1

 " the celebration " is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant . you know where you sit down to watch it and no matter what you've heard about it before you just can't help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs . i prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like . i don't really feel there are to be any real " rules " for cinema ; a film can do anything as long as it makes it work . but i do,1

scream 2 isn't quite as clever as its predecessor but it fills the gap with a cutting wit . death -- even gruesome bloody death -- can be funny if handled the right way ( some will be offended by this statement but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example ) . and while there's plenty of horror to go around in scream 2 the latest '90s slasher flick incarnation there are also a few laughs to be had . scream 2 is a slice-and-dice movie for those who don't take their ,1

the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made . i know that is very sweeping statement so i'll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of " science fiction " stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot . 2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science . most all other films we normally ,1

martin scorsese's kundun which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure . personally i don't think it needs one : it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china . scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do as a larger-than-life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership : the only glimpses into his head come f,1

i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files . first let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . the producers are not stupid making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . you have to reach for a larger audience . therefore the movie is quite user-friendly . altough non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange ,1

the happy bastard's 30-second review : american pie the summer of raunch continues to spread into theatres with this latest yuk fest filled with sick jokes and teen dialogue aplenty . if you go expecting dawson's creek you're in for a problem . if your expectations are lower ( and better i might add ) you will enjoy the hell out of american pie . the movie casts several unknowns with the only real recognizable one being sctv's own eugene levy as a happy-go-lucky dad . the story r,1
in some respects rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking . the hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone . the cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble . all chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element . the duo must always be completely mismatched . the hero has to say some smart-assed comment before ( and after ) shooting someone . however that doesn't necessarily make for a bad film . rush hour is jackie chan's first ,1
my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance ( or a movie that we've all seen a million times ) two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins . this is exactly what happened in this movie but fortunately they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way . the movie starts with a quick ( and i do mean quick ) glance of two presidents russell kramer ( jack lemmon ) and matt douglas ( james garner ) . william haney ( dan aykroyd ) and,1

the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer/director/producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director he really is . he wrote this film he directed this film he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film . i think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has not lost it's popularity or it's ability to scare the wits out of people . i think i have seen ',1
i have to admit that i disliked this film initially . it certianly isn't for every taste and it's sheer torture to sit through if you're in a restless mood . that said if you are in the right mood it's absolutely incredible . this was my second favorite movie of 1998 and would have been a shoo-in for first in almost any other year . perhaps the big turn-off for many was this film's unconventionality . i'd be hard-pressed to compare it to any other film that i've seen - it is very ,1

the rich man's wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double where the story and characters are so one-dimensional and contrived that you know you shouldn't be enjoying yourself . but somehow the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things . not that it's bad it's just that it's been done before ; and better in my opinion . i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre but it's probably the best analogy that i can co,1

i can sum up first strike in one word : awesome . never in my life have i seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan . for the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movie he's ever appeared in he should be awarded greatly . the same tom and jerry formula that was used to make chan's rumble in the bronx and supercop so entertaining can be found here as well . however first strike was probably the most exciting out of the three for the simple reason that,1

that thing you do ! from first-time film director tom hanks is an enjoyable tale about a fictional band the wonders that goes from a garage band to the band with the fastest selling album in the country . but the question arrises will the seduction of fame and fortune corrupt the band and lead them to become just another one-hit wonder or will they stick together and become the next teen sensations ? the " oneders " as they are originally known have their first gig at a very ,1

the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80's . more practiced as a cinematographer than a director bava nonetheless sat in the director's chair for beyond the door ii the project which turned out to be his last full-length feature film . alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci beyond the door ii is simply a revelation . in his day bava was consid,1
the makers of jurassic park & the director of speed conjure up a storm !

there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor's effort . often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile . when one of these comes along i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders . but sometimes there is simply no other explanation and such is the case with " the hurrican,1
david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head . it is one of many science fiction films released during the last year of this millenium that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future . the story unfolds in a near future where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs . the world of the future is an unfriendly place where the scared inhabitants are " hiding " in virtual reality fantasy games to escape t,1

call me crazy but i don't see saving private ryan as the film of the summer . a good movie yes with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare . an utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg's best work no . personally if i was spielberg i wouldn't go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindler's list and the indiana jones movies . i'm guessing steve has a thing for nazis ; i really wouldn't be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swasti,1
seen august 8 1998 at 6 p . m . at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam ny ) theater #6 by myself for free using my sony/loews critic's pass . [theater rating : * * * : good seats sound and picture] war is a topic that can't help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media . movies documentaries and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on such as strategy politics and victory . ,1

what is a scary movie anyhow ? is it a movie where a person gets ripped to shreds ? is it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge ? possibly its some guy with a hook who wants to know what you did last summer . what ever happened to horror movies where the horror was in the atmosphere and in the characters . movies like " halloween " and " psycho " which revolutionized horror genre forever but wait in 1973 came a movie based on the bestselling book by ,1
a wonderful little movie that is really interested in its characters and in its theme . the scene of " second best " is laid in wales . james ( chris cleary miles ) is a 10-year-old boy who must live in a home because his father ( keith allen ) is in prison and his mother committed suicide . james is a mentally unbalanced child . he can't forget what happened in the past and he dreams of living a happy life with his beloved father . in the home he feels sadly and lonely . one day a soc,1

trekkies roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions . the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike . ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs . trekker polemic as not worth arguing about . ) the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable loud giggles yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a ,1
if you're the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland you're going to love the hunt for red october . you'll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics or if you're a sean connery or alec baldwin fan or if you admired director john mctiernan's earlier films die hard and predator . in fact the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book since films almost never live up ,1
i was pleasantly surprised by this film . with a budget topping $200 million i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see . how much could you dress up the sets ? how many models and computer effects could you use ? how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ? oh if i've just given away part of the plot for you go back to school . after having viewed titani,1
it was easy to fear the worst . begin with a classic 1960's television series add a big budget and an a-list star in the lead role and stir . script you ask ? who needs one kid . . . we've got ourselves a formula . that was my fear : a bloated monster without any sense of direction . then much to my amazement everything that could possibly go wrong . . . didn't . the fugitive is as lean taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years . un,1
it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system . no major surprise when j . s . mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either . the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority . small wonder that hollywood's most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual-underdog against,1

vampire films as well as other horror films are usually dumb and predictable b-movies meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks . it is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning but has also a plot worth making movies about . based on anne rice's novel " interview with a vampire " is a long dark trip to hell . the film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of present-day san francisco . the camera slowly find particular win,1
one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids . although black-and-white films are frequently viewed as suspect ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind . and if you can find a colorful action film even if it is from six decades ago then there is a real possibility of a take home hit . so it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up a ,1
swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults . steven spielberg may not have directed ( he only executive produced ) but his touch certainly is evident in this movie . and he knows a money making winner when he sees one . the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster : big action funny comedy and the pacing of a rollercoaster . hopkins plays don diego de la vega otherwise known as zorro . a fighter for the people he is eventually captured by don raf,1
david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director . with his distinctive more often than not ingenious dialogue and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible . some of them tend to be thickly layered deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message or sometimes even a concealed storyline . and although the re,1
when casting the key part of the voice of moses most people's first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer ( the saint and the island of dr . moreau ) but he was dreamworks's choice in their first traditionally animated movie the prince of egypt . the selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasn't in the casting department . the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical,1

let's face it : the $100 million-plus smash that was " goldeneye " was not a good film by any means and as a bond movie was only marginally better than say " a view to a kill " or either of the timothy dalton pictures by virtue of nice pacing . but it did revive the series and granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it ( ie . the new " m " is a woman ) .

if this keeps up jane austen ( sense and sensibility pride and prejudice ) may have to apply for posthumous membership to the screen writers guild . yet another novel of hers has made the transition to the silver screen . mansfield park is a turn of the century ( 18th century going on 19th ) story about love among the classes as well as an examination into proper society and family ties . ten year old fanny price ( hannah taylor-gordon jakob the liar ) taken from her mother and father,1
saving private ryan ( dreamworks ) running time : 2 hours 48 minutes . starring tom hanks edward burns tom sizemore and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the 'greatest war movie ever made ' saving private ryan is an harrowing saddening and riveting movie . it may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion but it's certainly one of the best war movies made and one of the best of 1998 . tom hanks stars as a captain who's troop has to find private ryan ,1
50's `aliens vs . earth' idea revamped ! if you have been following the movie news over the net you could not have escaped the hype over id4 . it promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary . id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july and up till now only after a week of release it has nearly touched the us$100 million mark a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993 . the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple : earth,1
the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily . three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making . they disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house . from there things become a little more complicated . i can say with absolute assurance that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has ,1
apocalypse now based on the novel " hearts of darkness " is an extremely striking gripping and horrifying depiction of the vietnam war from another angle . a long debate has surrounded this movie as if it is actually an anti-war film . in many ways this debate could go either way . apocalypse now is probably one of the most memorable vietnam war films ever made . in addition now film has gone to the extremes that this film does - a disturbing look at the corruption and terrifying,1
sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to . it's not the time or the distance it's the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy . yet somehow the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story . the wings of the dove fits the pattern . kate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love . merton a newspaper writer would like to marry kate . but kate's " job " if ,1
earlier this year the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics . a real charmer of a movie it's possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience . now at the end of 1998 comes waking ned devine a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter . there's no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere -- they strike all the same chords -- but still ,1

just in time for halloween and christmas the reissue of the nightmare before christmas couldn't be more appropriate . with all of the attention thrown to " family films " in recent years namely those starring pocket monsters and nickelodeon characters it's high time we raised the intellectual level of children's fare as well as the animation achievements of the movie studios . with that in mind it was refreshing to revisit an animation classic on the big screen that still retains the o,1
every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre : with dramas it was citizen kane with arthouse it was pulp fiction and with comedy it was well that jim carrey guy ( okay so he's not a movie but he did have a huge influence on the genre . not to mention an expensive one . ) sometimes a movie even combines them all into a big sprawling motion picture event as did forrest gump four years ago . with action films it was aliens whic was released ,1
it has happened again . a movie that is well scripted well acted and well directed . it is involving suspenseful . . . it even has an unexpected twist at the end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus . but in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie . the sixth sense is that movie . starring bruce willis ( armageddon ) as a child psychologist and haley joel osment ( forrest gump ) as a troubled youngster the sixth sense is more spooky than scary,1
in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies payback was better than conspiracy theory but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon . in other words it's a decent couple of hours of entertainment but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson's greatest hits payback probably won't be on it . gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll . mel's partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt . so he puts a couple of bullets in mel,1
the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of " leila " a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u . s . distribution thanks to first run features . although unfamiliar with mehrjui's previous directing efforts perhaps the reason for this is that while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country ,1
it's an interesting premise . our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real . in truth our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains . what we see what we do everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence . our bodies severely atrophied are kept alive for the sole pur,1
one of kyle mclachlan's earlier cinematic features this movie has had an obvious influence on such films as the terminator ( 8/10 ) species ( 7/10 ) and the more recent fallen with denzel washington . plot : a science-fiction picture set in modern times this thriller follows the exploits of an " entity " from outer space who likes to inhabit human bodies use them up until they are completely worn out and then switch over to the next available receptacle . fbi agent ( mclachlan ) ,1
of the major horror sub-genres vampire movies are easily the most adaptable . think about it . frankenstein movies haven't changed all that much because they still need that mad-scientist-in-bavarian-castle setting . if you made a frankenstein movie today you'd have to have the monster be a virus or something -- and outside of michael j . fox there aren't any actors that could play a virus convincingly . movies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt . there's not much you c,1
there's some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably shouldn't and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did . " lucky numbers " is a perfect example of this because it's such a blatant rip-off of " fargo " and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me . i know i'm in the minority here but let me explain . the film takes place in harrisburg pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter . john travolta plays the local big-shot tv weathe,1
this summer one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham's series a time to kill was made into a major motion picture . on january 3 of this year director rob reiner basically re-released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi . based on the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars' assassination ghosts of mississippi revolves around the 25-year legal battle faced by myrlie evars ( whoopi goldberg sister act ) and her quest to have her husband's obv,1

as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it the more pleased i was when i left . first getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : " if you liked scream you'll love wild things !

i guess it's a credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour 2 could not be ruined even by the nauseating " comedy " of chris tucker . i'm a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium and this movie lets him not only do his impressive-as-ever martial arts schtick but show off his comic timing as well . it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title . the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effec,1
some critics including siskel & ebert are on the record stating that martin scorsese's raging bull the story of boxer jake la motta is the best film of the '80s . since there are still a number of '80s films that i haven't seen i don't feel qualified to make such a judgment but i'll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 1980 and december 31 1989 come close to its l,1
much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of " lolita " made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made over its use of pedophilia and as such it's important to address it straight-forwardly before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years lying around in vaults san a distributor and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call,1

not since 1996's shine which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world-class musicians . in fact if one were to watch these films together it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills . yet hilary and jackie the sophomore effort from director anand tucker has something more to say -- it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of,1

when i was growing up in 1970s boys in my school used to divide into two groups based on their action movies preferences . the first one myself included liked movies that featured spectacular car chases lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks probably because they could ( or to be more precise thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . decades later while refining my own cinematic taste i began to,1

studio expectations must not have been high for " great expectations " -- the film's release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999 . it's actually a smart move because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale isn't quite oscar fodder it * is * strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five o,1

vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents . and unlike any of the more outlandish myths the vampire holds some real-world probability ( one study claims 1 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide and places 50 in los angeles ) . but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys john carpenter would like to remind us that t,1
if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia . although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle's high school reunion ) some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones . until that happens 1980s would be remembe,1

the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one . it's 1971 and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash-outs among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his " attorney " dr . gonzo ( benito del toro ) . these two spend most of the film in a drug-induced stupor having strange hallucinations trashing their hotel rooms and either annoying or scaring almost eve,1

kirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue . all he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow and you instantly know what he's thinking .

the characters in " palmetto " collectively sweat enough to fill lake erie and it's just the right way to capture the film's ripe atmosphere of sensuality tension and even farce . this humid florida-set thriller nurtures a modestly absurd edginess that often winks at itself which is very much a good thing since the actors and director are in on the joke . as far as set-up is concerned the movie is nothing we haven't seen before but be patient -- " palmetto " spins some pretty wicked ,1

while watching " shallow grave " i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens' " blood simple . " both are good films in which several characters none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes . the body count rises and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands . both films are also flawed but for different reasons .,1

" can only be leading up to letdown . that's no doubt -- it seems any movie with critical acclaim makes you think you're going in for the ride of your life that you'll end up changed on the other side and you come out of the theater going " eh . . . * that's * what all the fuss was about ?

go's is a gloriously slick hip machine . director liman ( who also photographed go ) and screenwriter august celebrate the drug/rave scene in l . a . preferring to take ( comedic ) snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them . after more than ninety minutes of pill-popping tantric sex car chases and attempted murder go even has a happy ending . this is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches ; as go wound down i anticipated an anti-,1
what's shocking about " carlito's way " is how good it is . having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino's previous film " scent of a woman " and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one ( he had just won an oscar ) " carlito's way " was destined for underrated heaven . that's what it is : an underrated gem of a movie . and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy ,1
life is beautiful is a rare treat : a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful or even worse humorless . it combines a charming romance with a dash of farce stirs in a little poignancy and ends up a very enjoyable movie . it's an italian film but don't let that discourage you . subtitle-phobes will be missing a wonderful experience . life is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy with the clownish but good ,1
you've probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over `keeping the faith' . it's a fluffy comedy thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer regarding two moral topics -- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head-on . as youngsters brian finn jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio . while their friendship progressed anna,1
naturally at the core of leon gast's " when we were kings " is the fight itself for what a fight it was . thanks to the business savvy of don king an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman . fans were treated to an 8 round battle of endurance and strategy as much as brute strength that immediately entered boxing lore . with the benefit of the first-hand recollections of that old ex-pug norman mailer this classic conflict i,1
while screen adaptations of john irving's novels have been disappointingly uneven the films have all shared one particular strength : key casting . who can forget john lithgow as roberta muldoon the transsexual quarterback of " the world according to garp " or nastassja kinski as susie the bear in " the hotel new hampshire " ? a lot of good casting decisions have gone into the making of " the cider house rules " an adaptation of irving's poetic 1994 novel about a restless young man cal,1
scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well . during a film-class discussion windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are and why sequels never live up to the originals . a few rare exceptions are noted but they left out one . . . scream 2 ! 1996's surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america ! ,1
devotees of robert a . heinlein be forewarned : paul verhoeven's starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein's novel than it is a literary satire . the author's jingo-all-the-way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless faceless parade of carnage from the film version . and i suppose that's exactly what verhoeven delivers with sometimes hilarious results . heinlein's basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that t,1

is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of all-time ? it's quite possible . his career spanned over 40 years and he acted in more movies than most actors ever could . yet when he is talked about in the media he is generally thought of as an actor who played one type of role : the nice guy . and that's really a shame .

when a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space . it really is too bad that comedies are so hit- and-miss because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver . but weep not dear readers because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet . austin powers :,1
almost a full decade before steven spielberg's saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both " anti war " and " pro-soldier " john irvin's hamburger hill proved it could . lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone's platoon this excellent film was dismissed as " too militaristic " . it's hard to understand exactly why---unless irvin in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable ( and often naive ) reasons " chose to show up " for,1
in these days of overlong movies ( meet joe black the thin red line the mask of zorro ) it is a shame that films like waking ned devine can't be longer than a paltry 90 minutes . this is just a cute movie even through its mildly risque subject matter . old friends jackie ( bannen ) and michael ( kelley ) try to find the lottery winner ( they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60 ) so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings . through process of elimination they,1

anyone who saw alan rickman's finely-realized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor-turned-director is a bit of a poet at heart . however for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood : prince of thieves this recognition may be something of a shock . nevertheless " poetic " is an excellent term to describe rickman's feature debut as a director the winter guest . the film has a simple unhurri,1
i want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david lean's war picture . i still think that " the bridge on the river kwai " doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies . and i think that " 12 angry men " " witness for the prosecution " and " paths of glory " would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957 . but i can't deny the importance of " the bridge on the river kwai " - cinem,1
recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville-one from entertainment weekly one from a newsgroup and two from different online resources . each review compared this film to the truman show . why ? the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television . other than that the two movies are completely different from each other . reviewers seem to love to pick one movie ( i . e . the truman show ) obsess over it and make it a guidel,1

it's no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office . a poorly-written script can be bested by a superb acting corps and a well-written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs . in directing his latest action-comedy director brett ratner ( money talks ) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get-out buddy cop movie . in addition rush ,1

satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long-term satire where everything including the jokes is somehow related on a large scale ( i . e . " dr . strangelove " ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e . " men in black " ) . what's unique about " wag the dog " is that it doesn't necessarily fit either of these descriptions and yet is both at the same time . the result is a clever comedy based ,1

showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven director and joe eszterhas writer . their last effort basic instinct played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone's taste but certainly a well-crafted movie . possibly that movie's greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage prior to the ,1

i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars . from my first viewing i noticed that david mamet's film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning . from my second viewing however i noticed that mamet's script was actually a masterpiece . the spanish prisoner like the usual suspects or chinatown begs for the viewer's complete attention . miss a scene or even a small detail and you could miss the meaning,1

upon taking a seat at the theater and surveying the crowd i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises . i'm twenty-two but have been accused of looking sixteen . yet as the film began any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five close-knit yet troubled sisters . director pat o'connor ( inventing the abbots circle of friends ) weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss need and the bonds between five sisters . the family is ruled by kate (,1

after being hypnotized a man believes there is a ghost in his house . the review two low-key summer horror films have become surprise financial successes this year : the blair witch project and the sixth sense . each has made well over $100 million in north america based on a combination of strong word of mouth and clever advertising . if a film's box office take were based primarily on its quality stir of echoes would join blair and sense in grossing far more money than expected for,1
being the self-proclaimed professional film critic that i am i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia ( coming soon to dvd ) until only recently . after all it's considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai and doctor zhivago . so one day a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it . i was initially skeptical that something,1
my summer was recently saved by two very different movies . on opening night i saw american pie 2 and laughed like a moron . then a few nights later i watched and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershman's greenfingers even though it didn't feature a trip to band camp girl-on-girl action or seann william scott . however i felt just as good leaving american pie 2 as i did after leaving greenfingers which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs ( clive owen of croupier ) . ,1
what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection . sometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have i will prefer it to a better-made film that is not as thought-provoking . the thin red line is flawed but it provokes . terence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war . unlike this year's saving private ryan which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof ,1

wong kar-wei's " fallen angels " is on a purely visceral level one of the most exciting films i've seen in a long while . unfortunately wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for . ordinarily that alone would be enough to sink a movie but in the case of " fallen angels " this is not so . every shot in this film is exciting just to * look * at . wong does really interesting things with the camera but,1

robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible god-given gifts but are able to act like ordinary people . in " the natural " ( 1984 ) he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs the baseball player who was destined to be " the best there ever was " but still acted like a humble farm boy . in " butch cassidy and the sundance kid " ( 1969 ) he was the most dangerous shot in the west yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good-looking char,1

usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock . others will mention meg ryan . but for me it's not even close . janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now . and it's a good thing she's starring in the matchmaker because without her presence the movie would be bland unfunny and dull . garofalo stars as marcy tizard a t,1
labelling is sometimes everything . in original mad max the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future thus making it one of the science fiction classics despite the future world being almost exactly like our own . walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors . producers weren't thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones . on the other hand producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accuse,1

perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects . there is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise . whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years such as raiders of the lost ark were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology . the latest in thi,1

bill condon's " gods and monsters " is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) who made the horror classics " frankenstein " and " bride of frankenstein . " since i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film there is no way to know how accurate the film is but i suspect that much of it only came from whale's inner fantasies and hallucinations . whale who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror p,1
a cinematic version of one of john irving's novels is always cause for celebration even if as in the case of " simon birch " the treatment is merely " suggested by " rather than strictly based on the book . suggested means that irving author of the acclaimed " the world according to garp " sold the rights to his novel " a prayer for owen meany " to the disney machine for $1 million but wouldn't grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names . that's a,1

usually when a blockbuster comes out it's loaded with effects stars bad scripts and plenty of action . mystery men may contain an all-star cast and efects but the clever script and characters are what really works which is rare to see this year . the film is based upon the comic book series " the flaming carrot " by bob burden in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime only to be out done by the real hero of champion city captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) . things,1

martin scorsese's triumphant adaptation of edith wharton's the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life . it seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900's but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker . this is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese's fi,1

the most amazing thing about paul cox's innocence is how unlike a movie it is . i mean that as the highest compliment . if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance i'd want to run and hide . the sex scenes would be handled as a farce producers would shed 20 years off the characters' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence . along with a charming roma,1

i swear i have seen the edge before . in fact it reminded me of the bear the river wild and other various films mixed into an entirely different film . however the edge has done something that most action films should do and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot . in doing so the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than say the peacemaker . unfortunately because of those overused moments we can pretty much guess the outcome of the,1
one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made " se7en " is just a few steps away from brilliance . however those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss . the film received mixed reviews upon release but there's an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice . at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing but the script and the ultimate,1
there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review not because of their own complexity but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original . one of such masterpieces is casablanca probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art but definitely the most popular one . its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere but also i,1
like the great musical pieces of mozart himself amadeus is a true work of art . it is one of those few movies of the 80's that will be known for its class its style and its intelligence . why is this such a good film ? there are almost too many reasons to explain . the story : court composer salieri ( f . murray abraham ) feels waves of different emotions going through his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart ( tom hulce ) comes into his life as the young genius composer . salieri feels e,1

not too many people know who james whale is but it's a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies . if we are to believe the semi- biographical gods and monsters whale would have wanted it to be that way . this is an insightful haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie . gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of,1
when i initially set out to review this film my tag line was going to be " you too can believe whales can fly " . then it was going to be " you too can believe pastel triangles can fly " . then it was going to be " you too can believe wood sprites can fly " . finally i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . . there's a lot of flying going on in this film ! as our first host steve martin tells us the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out ,1
it's tough to really say something nice about a type of person who's so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone but by god " american history x " does it and for that i commend it . it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who's not what they are and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off . the subject of this film is one of them but he is worse th,1

the idea at the center of the devil's advocate which is thus far one of the three or four best films of 1997 is that no matter what decision is made evil will triumph -- god is a trickster satan is a humanist -- " the last humanist " . he appears in many guises and seduces many men and women -- in his own words " vanity -- by far my favorite sin " . al pacino plays this role with relish and gets to chew some delectable lines ( " lemme givya a piece o' inside wisdom on god . .,1
scream 2 like its predecessor is a genre-crossing film . it is about 50% horror film and 50% murder mystery . the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time . scream was also known for its self-referential tone . many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven . again scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as " sequels suck " and " the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels .

when i first saw the previews for ron howard's latest film my expectations were discouragingly low . a show about nothing ? sounds like " seinfeld .

it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less-than-savoury character as mel gibson does in payback . of course if i was being paid $25 million for one month's work i'd probably be willing to take risks as well but that's neither here nor there . payback is based on a novel by richard stark ( apparently actually donald e . westlake author of the grifters itself a fine crime ,1

star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) review by matt pusateri few movies evoke nostalgia enthusiasm and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic star wars . the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture . arguably more americans today can explain what " the force " or a " jedi " is than a budget deficit or a serb . so 22 years after the releas,1
any movie about the underground music scene is a difficult beast to master . any meaning found in the underground is usually lost by the dumbing-down of the experience to make it " more accessible " to the general public . or the film is produced and directed by people that have about enough understanding of the subject matter that they ought to work as production assistants for vh1 . human traffic a new film exploring the british underground party/rave scene and the people immersed in the ,1
steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back ; he spent this time writing essays and short stories for " the new yorker " several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation pure drivel ( 1998 ) . much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview in a fine chapter called " in search of the wily filipino . " now as writer and star of bowf,1

how many of us would become strippers ? for those of us who wouldn't is it a moral reason or purely a lack of confidence ? that's probably not a fair question and for a lot of us it could very well be for neither of those reasons . as you watch the full monty however you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions . would you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough ? in case you haven't guessed the full monty is about stripping but striptease,1
director dominic sena ( who made the highly underrated kalifornia ) and producer jerry bruckheimer ( the rock armageddon ) bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen . nicolas cage plays memphis a retired car thief who's " pulled back in " to the business by an evil car thief overlord ( christopher eccleston ) determined to kill memphis' kid brother ( giovanni ribisi ) . memphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days ti,1
books could be and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy and rightfully so . this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s/early 80s inspiring literally dozens of clones from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre . the special effects were groundbreaking revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable wel,1
eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career . known for his notorious late 80's slump murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years . with the exception of the dreadful holy man he appears to be on pace for a full-fledged comeback . life was a great move on the part of murphy and co-star martin lawrence because it's a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slap-sticky drivel . director ted demme is smart enough ,1
capsule : the best place to start if you're a jackie chan newcomer . roars along never stops for breath and frequently hilarious . to talk about jackie chan as a " stuntman " is to miss a million things . jackie is not only one of the most accomplished and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts on the screen today but also a very funny guy . he reminds me of the way arnold schwartzenegger * used * to make me laugh -- he's funny just standing there copping a look . supercop has jackie m,1
the calendar year has not even reached its midway point but that hasn't prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar-bait season . bille august's high-profile adaptation of victor hugo's classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic--handsome production values strong performances by a top-notch cast a literate screenplay--with one critically missing element : emotional sweep . for those n,1
an entertaining 2 hours awaits the audience in this film set in the early 80's . sevigny and beckinsale play disco chicks alice and charlotte who are on the lookout for love . alice is mousy shy intellectual charlotte is bitchy out-going and fun . we join their adventures as they go through a variety of adventures and men all to the background of the local disco . whit stillman has both written and directed an interesting and believable story . alice and charlotte are both wel,1

the latest epos from lars is a blast although a rather moody one . this lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the 1970 something . the church ( calvinistic ) is so strict that the church bells has been removed from the clocktower they are considered being too unrestrained . in these surroundings we find the to-be-weds jan and bess played by stellan skarsgaard and the remarkable new movie actress emily watson . jan is on leav,1
anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases . . . ( especially hercules ) . . . emotion . all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren't going to hold anyone's interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together . not since disney's beauty & the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works . the story of the romanov fami,1

is it just me or have disney films gradually lost their appeal ? i was almost stunned by the quality of " who framed roger rabbit ? " a fun unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together . " the little mermaid " harkened back to and perhaps surpassed the classic disney animations from the first half of the century . however the endless stream of " the little mermaid " wanna-be's is getting to me . you know the spiel : a lame plot recycled from some well-known st,1
insane ( but inspired ) musical about alferd packer the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america . as the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer ( trey parker ) supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold . throughout packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse a tribe of `ute' indians that doesn't seem quite on the mark and a terrible winter storm that l,1
synopsis : in phantom menace the galaxy is divided into power groups whose interests will inevitably collide in later sequels . there is an overarching galactic united nations-type organization called the senate presided by a weak chancellor . within the senate two camps are at odds : a bickering isolationist alliance called the republic and their aggressive rival the trade federation . preserving law and order are a council of jedi knights who are meanwhile searching for a prophesied chose,1
at one point during brian de palma's crime epic scarface the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino and pops a question that the audience has no doubt been wanting to ask for themselves : " can't you stop saying 'fuck' all the time ? " fucking good question that . it may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride but as far as i can tell oliver stone's script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history . yet it would be a ,1

i like movies with albert brooks and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks . lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies . his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator . you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent " talk films " which are f,1
 ( note : there are spoilers regarding the film's climax ; the election of course ) we see matthew broderick a man torn to a primal state ; he's been unfaithful to his wife lied to and manipulated his students and by the same token they've demeaned his masculinity his self-respect his desperate attempt at changing the world . and yet he equates the cause of his pain his torment with tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) . no matter how many students have come and gone and disa,1
martin scorsese's films used to intimidate me . because of his reputation i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks . as much as i enjoyed them i usually felt like i missed something . i learned from scorsese's casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story . no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies . for example in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words,1
let's say you live at the end of an airport runway . large jetliners continuously pass over your house rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace . let's say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home . now let's say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway and offers you more than it's worth . wouldn't you jump in the air an,1
 " no man is an island " one character quotes john donne in apt pupil effectively summarizing the movie's themes . while hardly a great film singer's ambitious adaptation of king's short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . 1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts h,1
i rented this movie with very high hopes . this movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 and unfortunately was not as good as i hoped but was still very intriguing and thought provoking . first of all the casting for this film is great . tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood . they play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly . with a plot as unbelievable as this film you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast . tobey and,1
now that " boogie nights " has made disco respectable again ( well fashionable at least ) we shouldn't be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era . the latest art house interpretation is whit stillman's " the last days of disco . " stillman who made " metropolitan " and " barcelona " using some of the same actors uses disco's final hours to highlight what is another conversation-heavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director . the young upw,1
this has been an extraordinary year for australian films . " shine " has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards picking up best film best actor best director etc . to that we can add the gritty " life " ( the anguish courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hiv-positive section of a jail ) and " love and other catastrophes " ( a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a university campus ) . i can't recall a year in which such a ,1
trees lounge is the directoral debut from one of my favorite actors steve buscemi . he gave memorable performences in in the soup fargo and reservoir dogs . now he tries his hand at writing directing and acting all in the same flick . the movie starts out awfully slow with tommy ( buscemi ) hanging around a local bar the " trees lounge " and him pestering his brother . it's obvious he a loser . but as he says " it's better i'm a loser and know i am then being a loser and not think,1
i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials but there isn't . george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant special effects-bound flicks and he has done it again . this is the first star wars film i've seen on the big screen so of course the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video . what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story but its ama,1
lisa cholodenko's " high art " is an intelligent quiet drama . its strongest quality aside from the top-notch central performances is the perceptive way in which the film also written by cholodenko observes its characters . they are all flawed people some more troubled than others but they are not judged . judging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers' parts because no one no matter how bad off they are deserve to be negatively judg,1
plot : this movie takes place over one day . it's a rookie cop's narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran . the rookie doesn't know much about " street justice " so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the " real world " . how even cops like themselves have to " bend the rules " and " break the law " every now and then in order to catch the really bad guys . critique : a pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board some ups some downs,1
a thriller set in modern day seattle that marked marky mark's migration from the " good vibrations " and " calvin klein undie ad " guy to mark wahlberg thespian-at-large and a mighty good one at that . plot : boy ( wahlberg ) meets girl ( witherspoon ) . boy likes girl . girl likes boy . boy and girl begin dating . parents of girl aren't crazy about the boy . girl steps to boy's defense . family problems occur . girl learns more about the boy . boy goes nuts . fun ensues . cri,1
wow ! what a movie . it's everything a movie can be : funny dramatic interesting weird funny weird and strikingly original . yep that pretty much describes this movie . it starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest funniest most original movies i have ever seen . it boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often . besides being one of the best films of the year being john malkovich may as well be one of the bes,1
richard gere can be a commanding actor but he's not always in great films . everything comes together here . gere is a big time chicago defense attorney who takes on a seemingly unwinable case in hopes of even more publicity . it doesn't go exactly as he expects . gere's client aaron ( edward norton ) is a shy stuttering tennessee boy who is accused of brutally murdering and mutilating a catholic archbishop . the evidence is stacked against him . he was caught running from the scene ,1
steven spielberg's second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film . spielberg ever the student on film has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest and most powerful entries . he also managed to cast this era's greatest answer to jimmy stewart tom hanks who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle . for about 160 out of its 170 minutes " saving private ryan " is flawless . literally . the plot is ,1
truman ( " true-man " ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey's character in this film . president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature . " truman " also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans . and burbank california brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc . if hollywood is the center of the,1
