    "When we have multiple classifiers making predictions, we can treat each set of predictions as a column in a matrix. Here's an example where we have Decision Tree 1 (`DT1`), Decision Tree 2 (`DT2`), and Decision Tree 3 (`DT3`):\n",

    "```python\n",
    "DT1     DT2    DT3\n",
    "0       1      0\n",

    "0       0      1\n",
    "1       0      0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we add more models to our ensemble, we just add more columns to the combined predictions. Ultimately, we don't want this matrix, though -- we want one prediction per row in the training data. To accomplish this, we'll need to create rules to convert each row of our matrix of predictions into a single number.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to create a `Final Prediction` vector that looks like this:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "0       0      1      0\n",
    "1       0      0      0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to get from the output of multiple models to a final vector of predictions. One method is [majority voting](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Ensemble_learning#Voting_based_methods), in which each classifier gets a \"vote,\" and the most commonly voted value for each row \"wins.\" This only works if there are more than two classifiers (and ideally an odd number, so we don't have to write a rule to break ties). Majority voting is what we applied in the example above.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we only had two classifiers on the last screen, we'll have to use a different method to combine predictions. We'll take the mean of all of the items in a row. Right now, we're using the `predict()` method, which returns either `0` or `1`. `predict()` returns something like this:\n",

Because `0` and `1` are our two classes, we'll get a matrix containing the number of rows in the `income` dataframe, and two columns. `predict_proba()` will return a result that looks like this:\n",

    ".7    .3\n",
    ".2    .8\n",
    ".1    .9\n",
    "```\n",

    "Each row will correspond to a prediction. The first column is the probability that the prediction is a `0`, and the second column is the probability that the prediction is a `1`. Each row adds up to `1`.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we just take the second column, we get the average value that the classifier would predict for that row. If there's a `.9` probability that the correct classification is `1`, we can use the `.9` as the value the classifier is predicting. This will give us a continuous output in a single vector, instead of just 0 or 1.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can add together all of the vectors we get through this method, and divide the sum by the total number of vectors to get the mean prediction made across the entire ensemble for a particular row. Finally, we round off to get a `0` or `1` prediction for the row.<br>\n",
    "\n",

This is because while one tree can construct an incorrect and overfit model, the average of `100` or more trees will be more likely to hone in on the signal and ignore the noise. The signal will be the same across all of the trees, whereas each tree will hone in on the noise differently. This means that the average will discard the noise and keep the signal.<br>\n",

    "## When to Use Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see in the code cell from the previous screen, overfitting decreased with a random forest, and accuracy went up overall.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "While the random forest algorithm is incredibly powerful, it isn't applicable to all tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The main strengths of a random forest are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Very accurate predictions** - Random forests achieve near state-of-the-art performance on many machine learning tasks. Along with neural networks and gradient-boosted trees, they're typically one of the top-performing algorithms.\n",
    "* **Resistance to overfitting** - Due to their construction, random forests are fairly resistant to overfitting. We still need to set and tweak parameters like `max_depth` though.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The main weaknesses of using a random forest are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **They're difficult to interpret** - Because we've averaging the results of many trees, it can be hard to figure out why a random forest is making predictions the way it is.\n",
    "* **They take longer to create** - Making two trees takes twice as long as making one, making three takes three times as long, and so on. Fortunately, we can exploit multicore processors to parallelize tree construction. Scikit allows us to do this through the `n_jobs` parameter on RandomForestClassifier. We'll discuss parallelization in greater detail later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these trade-offs, it makes sense to use random forests in situations where accuracy is of the utmost importance; being able to interpret or explain the decisions the model is making isn't key. In cases where time is of the essence or interpretability is important, a single decision tree may be a better choice.<br>\n",
