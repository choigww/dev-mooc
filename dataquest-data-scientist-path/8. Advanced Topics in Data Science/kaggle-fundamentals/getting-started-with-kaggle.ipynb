    "## Introduction to Kaggle\n",
    "\n",
    "[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a site where people create algorithms and compete against machine learning practitioners around the world. Your algorithm wins the competition if it's the most accurate on a particular data set. Kaggle is a fun way to practice your machine learning skills.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission and the ones that follow, we're going to learn how to compete in Kaggle competitions. In this introductory mission we'll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Approach a Kaggle competition\n",
    "* Explore the competition data and learn about the competition topic\n",
    "* Prepare data for machine learning\n",
    "* Train a model\n",
    "* Measure the accuracy of your model\n",
    "* Prepare and make your first Kaggle submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course presumes you have an understanding of Python and the pandas library. If you need to learn about these, we recommend our Python and pandas courses.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle has created a number of competitions designed for beginners. The most popular of these competitions, and the one we'll be looking at, is about predicting which passengers survived the [sinking of the Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, we have a data set of different information about passengers onboard the Titanic, and we see if we can use that information to predict whether those people survived or not. Before we start looking at this specific competition, let's take a moment to understand how Kaggle competitions work.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Kaggle competition has two key data files that you will work with - a **training** set and a **testing** set.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The training set contains data we can use to train our model. It has a number of feature columns which contain various descriptive data, as well as a column of the target values we are trying to predict: in this case, `Survival`.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing set contains all of the same feature columns, but is missing the target value column. Additionally, the testing set usually has fewer observations (rows) than the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "![https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/185/kaggle_overview.svg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/185/kaggle_overview.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful because we want as much data as we can to train our model on. Once we have trained our model on the training set, we will use that model to make predictions on the data from the testing set, and submit those predictions to Kaggle.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, the two files are named `test.csv` and `train.csv`. We'll start by using the pandas library to read both files and inspect their size."
