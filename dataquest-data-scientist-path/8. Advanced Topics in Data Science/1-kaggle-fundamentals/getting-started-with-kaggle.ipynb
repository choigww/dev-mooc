    "## Introduction to Kaggle\n",
    "\n",
    "[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a site where people create algorithms and compete against machine learning practitioners around the world. Your algorithm wins the competition if it's the most accurate on a particular data set. Kaggle is a fun way to practice your machine learning skills.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission and the ones that follow, we're going to learn how to compete in Kaggle competitions. In this introductory mission we'll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Approach a Kaggle competition\n",
    "* Explore the competition data and learn about the competition topic\n",
    "* Prepare data for machine learning\n",
    "* Train a model\n",
    "* Measure the accuracy of your model\n",
    "* Prepare and make your first Kaggle submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course presumes you have an understanding of Python and the pandas library. If you need to learn about these, we recommend our Python and pandas courses.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle has created a number of competitions designed for beginners. The most popular of these competitions, and the one we'll be looking at, is about predicting which passengers survived the [sinking of the Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, we have a data set of different information about passengers onboard the Titanic, and we see if we can use that information to predict whether those people survived or not. Before we start looking at this specific competition, let's take a moment to understand how Kaggle competitions work.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Kaggle competition has two key data files that you will work with - a **training** set and a **testing** set.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The training set contains data we can use to train our model. It has a number of feature columns which contain various descriptive data, as well as a column of the target values we are trying to predict: in this case, `Survival`.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing set contains all of the same feature columns, but is missing the target value column. Additionally, the testing set usually has fewer observations (rows) than the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "![https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/185/kaggle_overview.svg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/185/kaggle_overview.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful because we want as much data as we can to train our model on. Once we have trained our model on the training set, we will use that model to make predictions on the data from the testing set, and submit those predictions to Kaggle.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, the two files are named `test.csv` and `train.csv`. We'll start by using the pandas library to read both files and inspect their size."

    "The files we read in the previous screen are available on [the data page for the Titanic competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). That page also has a **data dictionary**, which explains the various columns that make up the data set. Below are the descriptions contained in that data dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `PassengerID` - A column added by Kaggle to identify each row and make submissions easier\n",
    "* `Survived` - Whether the passenger survived or not and the value we are predicting (0=No, 1=Yes)\n",
    "* `Pclass` - The class of the ticket the passenger purchased (1=1st, 2=2nd, 3=3rd)\n",
    "* `Sex` - The passenger's sex\n",
    "* `Age` - The passenger's age in years\n",
    "* `SibSp` - The number of siblings or spouses the passenger had aboard the Titanic\n",
    "* `Parch` - The number of parents or children the passenger had aboard the Titanic\n",
    "* `Ticket` - The passenger's ticket number\n",
    "* `Fare` - The fare the passenger paid\n",
    "* `Cabin` - The passenger's cabin number\n",
    "* `Embarked` - The port where the passenger embarked (C=Cherbourg, Q=Queenstown, S=Southampton)\n",

    "## Exploring and Converting the Age Column\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Sex` and `PClass` columns are what we call **categorical** features. That means that the values represented a few separate options (for instance, whether the passenger was male or female).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the `Age` column using `Series.describe()`. You can run this code for yourself in the console, if you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> train[\"Age\"].describe()\n",
    "​\n",
    "    count    714.000000\n",
    "    mean      29.699118\n",
    "    std       14.526497\n",
    "    min        0.420000\n",
    "    25%       20.125000\n",
    "    50%       28.000000\n",
    "    75%       38.000000\n",
    "    max       80.000000\n",
    "    Name: Age, dtype: float64\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Age` column contains numbers ranging from `0.42` to `80.0` (If you look at Kaggle's data page, it informs us that `Age` is fractional if the passenger is less than one). The other thing to note here is that there are 714 values in this column, fewer than the 814 rows we discovered that the `train` data set had earlier in this mission which indicates we have some missing values.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this means that the `Age` column needs to be treated slightly differently, as this is a continuous numerical column. One way to look at distribution of values in a continuous numerical set is to use histograms. We can create two histograms to compare visually the those that survived vs those who died across different age ranges:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "survived = train[train[\"Survived\"] == 1]\n",
    "died = train[train[\"Survived\"] == 0]\n",
    "survived[\"Age\"].plot.hist(alpha=0.5,color='red',bins=50)\n",
    "died[\"Age\"].plot.hist(alpha=0.5,color='blue',bins=50)\n",
    "plt.legend(['Survived','Died'])\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The resultant plot will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/185/survived_age_hist.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/185/survived_age_hist.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship here is not simple, but we can see that in some age ranges more passengers survived - where the red bars are higher than the blue bars.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for this to be useful to our machine learning model, we can separate this continuous feature into a categorical feature by dividing it into ranges. We can use the [`pandas.cut()` function ](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.cut.html)to help us out.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`pandas.cut()` function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.cut.html) has two required parameters - the column we wish to cut, and a list of numbers which define the boundaries of our cuts. We are also going to use the optional parameter labels, which takes a list of `labels` for the resultant bins. This will make it easier for us to understand our results.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we modify this column, we have to be aware of two things. Firstly, any change we make to the `train` data, we also need to make to the `test` data, otherwise we will be unable to use our model to make predictions for our submissions. Secondly, we need to remember to handle the missing values we observed above.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we create a function that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* uses the [`pandas.fillna()` method](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.fillna.html) to fill all of the missing values with `-0.5`\n",
    "* cuts the `Age` column into three segments: `Missing`, `Child`, and `Adult` using `pandas.cut()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use that function on both the `train` and `test` dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def process_age(df,cut_points,label_names):\n",
    "    df[\"Age\"] = df[\"Age\"].fillna(-0.5)\n",
    "    df[\"Age_categories\"] = pd.cut(df[\"Age\"],cut_points,labels=label_names)\n",
    "    return df\n",
    "\n",
    "cut_points = [-1,0,18,100]\n",
    "label_names = [\"Missing\",\"Child\",\"Adult\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "train = process_age(train,cut_points,label_names)\n",
    "test = process_age(test,cut_points,label_names)\n",

    "![https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/185/cut.svg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/185/cut.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `cut_points` list has one more element than the `label_names` list, since it needs to define the upper boundary for the last segment."
