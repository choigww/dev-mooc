a follow-up to disney's live-action " 101 dalmatians " that's better more entertaining than the first ? just as unlikely . with " 102 dalmatians " the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs more is definitely * not * the merrier . 1996's " 101 dalmatians " certainly wasn't the greatest movie-going experience of all time but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous larger-than-life performance . in addition we had two amiable leads in the form of jef,-1
i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film . i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying " it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach . throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof ! we'll have a hit on our hands !

out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey a cold uninvolving confusing new thriller . though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight as well as jackie brown get shorty and pulp fiction ) after you watch it you realize that it's not nearly good enough . in an aggressively non-linear fashion the limey ( li * mey noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson (,-1
this feature is like a double header two sets of clich ? s for the price of one . not only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts but the banal rich girl-poor boy love story is tossed in for good measure . an original moment in this loser is as rare as a chicago cubs world series appearance . the screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins based on a story by falls merely lobs its plotline at the audience . this is a story that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching . su,-1
for better or worse the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated oversexed underwritten thrillers . apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn't change a thing since body of evidence wasn't written by him but has a puzzling eszterhas-ish presence all over it . in other words it's a ) really dirty and b ) really really stupid . madonna ( first warning sign ) stars in body of evidence as a woman who has pi,-1
edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back and like his previous two it is a working-class relationship picture . however unlike his previous work the film dwells on a more personal story and with a female protagonist . and in no looking back he stumbles making a slow boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work . claudia ( lauren holly ) is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life . she's at a turning point in her life and,-1

 " love to kill " starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes . at the outset the movie appears to be about tony danza who's an illegal distributor of guns trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman . danza sets up a double date with her her sister and a collegue of his . everything seems to be going well until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs . much confusion and mahem ensues as the death is covered up,-1
the happy bastard's quick movie review holy man more like holy crap . the film stars eddie murphy as a mystical-ish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs ( jeff goldblum and kelly preston ) with a flat tire on their hands . somehow he ends up in their car and on their channel a line-up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white morgan fairchild and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures . it's here that he see,-1

roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast " who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . . ben kingsley ? " my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark henry fonda in once upon a time in the west or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it . they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild sym,-1
when respecting a director you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect . woody allen has made a couple less-than good films and he's my favorite . even martin scorsese hasn't had a perfect track record . kevin smith after a smashing debut with the classic " clerks " stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful " mallrats .

 " some houses are born bad " goes the haunting's tag line to which i must add " some movies too . " nothing short of hiring a new cast a more literate screenwriter and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson's meritorious novel . the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects don't frighten so much as numb the audience into submission-the fil,-1

there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space - it's just that none of them happen to be actors . the stars i'm referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie's " outer space " ; the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home . yes in terms of acting the star power is . . . well more like a falling star . kinda pretty short-lived and pretty much dead . lost in space as if you really didn't know is bas,-1
nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl . the prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe in a languid southern drawl describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter h,-1
a big house . a big director jan de bont of speed and twister fame . a big star catherine zeta-jones hot of the heels of entrapment ( 6 . 5/10 ) and zorro . a big remake of the haunting . and big special effects . so what do they all amount to ? unfortunately for us a big bore ! plot : a hotshot doctor brings three insomniacs to an old spooky mansion for controlled testing . unbeknownst to the patients the good doctor is actually conducting his own cover project that has to d,-1
 " the animal " is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling . it's clunky and slow like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill . there are certainly better things you can do with your time . actually if you've seen the trailer then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments . the story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) who is an evidence clerk at the local police ,-1
54 is dull perfunctory uninspired and boring . a greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors . i however would rather cut to the chase . 54 is dull perfunctory uninspired and boring . there is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight . there is no electricity in any of the scenes or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots . and i,-1

susan granger's review of " america's sweethearts " ( columbia/sony ) what a waste of a talented cast ! billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan have concocted a sly provocative premise and as the opening credits roll it's obvious that they're attempting an old-fashioned romantic comedy . the story involves a veteran publicist ( billy crystal ) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director ( christopher walken ) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his,-1
this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue-collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times . it is hard to tell what is independent about this film ; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam . it is the debut film for the director who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults ,-1

it's probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre ( " the matrix " " existenz " ) would collide with the even more popular serial-killer genre ( " kiss the girls " " se7en " ) . the result should have been more interesting than " the cell .

the first image in " final fantasy : the spirits within " is a computer-animated close-up of a human eye . it's a beautiful piece of work remarkably detailed and quite convincing . when the picture pulls back to reveal the owner of the eye however things change . the young woman has mesmerizing hair although it hangs too artfully ? even by movie standards ? to be believed . the facial features are more detailed than any computer-animation seen to date but the result is more reminis,-1

at times you'd think edtv would be an entertaining film . i mean who can resist the story of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day ? but this average joe ed perkuny ( matthew mcconaughay ) is a sappy lifeless creation that wanders around trying to solve everyone's problems and settle his own . mcconaughay is awful especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard and torn jeans . fran,-1

it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller . some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may . both those films were tense exercises in chills . the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man john frankenheimer . but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively . for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films but has shown litt,-1

" that is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie . let me clear things up for you cupcake this isn't a bad b-movie it's a really bad b-movie . so bad it's almost good . almost but not quite . the movie starts off in the 1950's with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth . it is a bunch of slug-like creatures that kill people and take over their bodies . the slugs' fi,-1

the yet-to-be-released krippendorf's tribe is being marketed as a family comedy but buyer beware . this movie can't make up its mind . is it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies menstruation circumcision and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them ? or is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort ? either way " unbalanced " is the word to s,-1
despite its exceedingly well-done visual effects 1995's original species was one big hunk of sci-fi cheese from the writing to the feeble performances . so coming from such b-grade roots its sequel's stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising yet at the same time it is . it would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad if not even worse . something is clearly am,-1

years ago robin williams made _jumanji_ a brilliant achievement in special effects but a travesty on nearly every other level . the same can be said for _what dreams may come_ a boring illogical weepie-wannabe that left my senses numb . don't get me wrong : i love breathtaking special effects and pulse-pounding imagery . _brazil_ is on my personal top ten . _the city of lost children_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios . i even love _2001_ and _last year at mari,-1

how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres ? isn't there a law or something ? this diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg's dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst . mouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat-out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison . writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill . the plo,-1
i don't appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting when in fact it's ludicrous . in the case of the general's daughter the plot is more than capable of intriguing you to a certain point . but at this juncture in the story the movie begins to fall apart like a crumbling cookie . this predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of it's detailed flaws . get past one ,-1

let's get this one over with as quickly as possible . if there was a possibility to receive a refund this review would not be forthcoming . but as it is " godzilla " is without a doubt the loudest longest and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio . producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch " last year at merienbad " until they can grasp the idea,-1
there's no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based as its opening credits proclaim on a true story . but if it's an accurate picture of life on america's mean streets than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought . for from the film's outset when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song,-1

blatantly borrowing elements from 1993's " like water for chocolate " and 1991's " the butcher's wife " " simply irresistible " attempts to be a whimsical romantic comedy but more often than not comes off as laughable leaving you to wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar ( t . v .

what's to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornography--ie . the garbage known as " snuff " films ? nothing right ? what's to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography ? well . . . nothing . so why make it hollywood ? there's no reason why the average sane movie-goer will be interested in such a topic . no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this . the lack of quality filmmaking in " 8mm " ( ,-1

have you ever been in an automobile accident where you've miraculously walked away with only a few scratches yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable mangled wreck ? well that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation . but after watching this inane exercise of a movie i certainly feel that i've miraculously walked away unscathed after a two-hour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting ,-1
by-the-numbers : a film which introduces characters situations dilemmas and developments that we've seen before in a parade of other films . a film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one . a film which is packed to the cap with predictability leading to very little tension excitement suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience . in short a clich ? -ridden formula film . welcome to my review of the general's daughter . plot : an undercover army,-1
this is the movie that could single-handedly bring " mystery science theater 3000 " out of cancellation . it's one of those movies that's so bad it's absolutely hilarious due in no small part to its big star supermodel cindy crawford . if you only remember one thing about fair game it should be that it singlehandedly proves crawford should stick to the sports illustrated swimsuit issues . if you thought kathy ireland was laughable in alien from l . a . you'll change your mind when you,-1
as forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding especially three times . but alas professor brainard somehow manages to accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber . it's amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything . the whole point here is how could a man be so blatantly forgetful . this is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is a professor . well thi,-1

talk about beating a dead horse ! when home alone was released in 1990 it was a breath of fresh air and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely-funny family film . the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel so two years later we were subjected to home alone 2 which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited . for john hughes two home alone movies weren't enough ? he began recycling the same kind,-1
one night during a torrential downpour that flooded the streets we went to see -- what else -- hard rain . " so are we all going to die ? " the sheriff ( randy quaid ) asks in the story's opening line as he evacuates his flooded town . the answer is pretty much yes but not nearly soon enough . and to add insult to injury the supposedly dead regretfully often turn out not to be so . populating this bad tv-movie-of-the-week material are a host of talented actors . one can only,-1
if you're going to make a two-hour hollywood in-joke why bother releasing it to the general public ? if you're going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and people who know woody allen then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters ? while watching celebrity i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people . what he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation,-1
i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews and in both instances he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon . now i personally remember those films as a ) starring a major motion picture star b ) being funny c ) having great action sequences d ) great chemistry e ) decent character development . hmmm . . . . okay . . . now on to my review of chill factor . plot : a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice ,-1
sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things and " pushing tin " certainly features some name stars who are going places : billy bob thornton cate blanchett angelina jolie and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first but he's actually the * veteran * among this quartet of fine-looking people . sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has " hip comedy " written all over it compensate for workmanlik,-1
there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of " scream queen " in the early '80s . two of them were halloween movies but the other two -- prom night and terror train -- were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween . the same " god i'm scared there's some guy in a mask coming after me " routine she did in john carpenter's classic jamie lee copies here with none of the urgency or suspense . terror train takes place on ( where else ,-1
written by alex cox tod davies terry gilliam and tony grisoni directed by terry gilliam i've always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid . dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat and no idea how long the ride will last . then there's the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine-laced dose . mushr,-1
i'm guessing -- and from the available evidence it's not a great guess -- that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess stupidity ego and power-mongering . if so the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history . it has already been well-documented that the original title an alan smithee film became a problem when miserable test screenings forced re-cuts against the will of director,-1
don't get me wrong -- i tend to appreciate besson's naive unashamedly romantic worldview an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood . his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman and 1997's the fifth element is a goofy paean to love l-u-v that's even more of a hoot on repeated viewings . but his joan of arc is a mess despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a ,-1
 " tarzan and the lost city " is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while . not only it is poorly written badly acted and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid . unfortunately it's not bad in the way great colossal misfires like " heaven's gate " ( 1980 ) or " ishtar " ( 1987 ) were bad . instead it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with which begs the question of why it was,-1
a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided for this confused confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle producer andrew macdonald and screenwriter john hodge . at the core of this strange film is a fairly basic--and yes ordinary--premise . after robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgrego,-1
depending on your degree of cinematic acumen last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line . new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing,-1
okay okay . maybe i wasn't in the mood to watch a mindless action movie ; i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii even while admitting that it wasn't as good as the others . howewer the latest segal picture didn't look that bad and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash . boy was i wrong ! in the first half of the movie we are already assaulted with segal's acting ( he is not si,-1
it's a good thing most animated sci-fi movies come from japan because " titan a . e . " is proof that hollywood doesn't have a clue how to do it . i don't know what this film is supposed to be about . from what i can tell it's about a young man named kale who's one of the last survivors of earth in the early 31st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and re-generating what is left of the human race . that's a fine premise for an action-packed sci-fi animated movie but there',-1
stallone attempts to 'act' in this cop drama . the film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal who's nephew ( played by michael rappaport ) is involved in a car crash and killing of two black youths . keital dosen't really want to get involved in anything gets rid of rappaport and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on . this film should be brilliant . it sounds like a great plot the actors are first grade and the supporting cast is good aswell,-1
ex-universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer-model engineered fighters gone bad . the review jean-claude van damme has a one-liner early on in universal soldier : the return his latest attempt to remain relevant that sums up this entire movie ; he says " been there done that .

perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with " . . . this is the fake news " norm macdonald at times could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi-offensive phrases in his raspy voice coated with a condescending attitude . his shtick was marked by crassness . in this movie for example when his girlfriend says that she's kicking him out because he's been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months ,-1

absolute power the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff . it is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper . one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood . not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived but even the writing itself lacks any consist,-1
'bicentennial man' is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment . chris columbus the director who gave you " mrs . doubtfire " plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point . based on the short story by isaac asimov it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human which as you can imagine is very difficult . starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on,-1
that thing you do !

disney's 35th animated feature-- a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with well the superman story-- is surprisingly soft at the center . great wit great art and a great villain ( james woods as hades lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) can't quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil ) and a largely unremarkable soundtrack .

logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility . considering that the skeptic's best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task . occasionally we get a film that does manage it . terry gilliam's " 12 monkeys " was one such film . but more frequently we get films that don't much deal with it at all . there is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues th,1
wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon denise richards and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex love murder and betrayal . the setting of the film is a town named blue bay . it consists of many swamps and slums and on the other hand rich estates owned by the town's different benefactors . the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town's ritzy expensive high school . it is here that we meet all of the core characters ,1

james l . brooks one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news returns to the big screen with this entertaining if slightly flawed comedy . nicholson plays melvin udall probably the most horrible person ever on the screen . he's racist homophobic and never has a good word to say to anyone . so nobody talks to him except waitress carol conelly ( t . v sitcom star hunt who was last seen in twister 1996 ) . naturally udall conelly and gay neighbor,1

the long and illustrious career of robin williams which has included both forgettable turns like mrs . doubtfire and flubber was punctuated with the actor's first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting . it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989's dead poets society and critical remarks were unanimously positive . his next role that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come was unfortunately lackluster . and so after a six-year stint as a comedic a,1

the thirteenth floor the third in what i would call " the reality check movie series " is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year the matrix and existenz . all three made you think made you wonder what is real what isn't and if our world is just a huge game . the thirteenth floor doesn't reach the level of originality creativity and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz but it certainly gives a great shot at it . in the matrix we were told ,1
i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club . a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown . in his films williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion leading to wildly uneven performances . mrs . doubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet . while it still contains some characteristic s,1

in some regards making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it . try too hard and it snaps ; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther . in simon birch director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique : he takes advantage of caution and poise but also risks his movie with a few bold steps . in the end he's not only holding an unbroken band but he makes the audience appreciate ,1
it's a fact that a good thriller or action movie doesn't need violence to be good or worth watching . all it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails . and what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermo-nuclear war ? and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon . a computer whiz-kid david is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades . but after having read an advertisment for an upcoming comp,1
a common complaint amongst film critics is " why aren't there more literate scripts available ? " quiz show gives signs of hope that the art of writing isn't dead in hollywood and that we need not only look to independent films for thoughtful content . paul attanasio's script takes what could have been a tepid thriller ( the quiz show scandals of the late 50s ) and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv,1

because the press screening of " planet of the apes " was one day past last issue's deadline i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece . the chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance that the story was thin that mark wahlberg's character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked . to those ,1
if you want some hearty laughs then rat race is the movie for you . this unpretentious little comedy which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype will have you bouncing in your theater seat . and while the film fits neatly into the low-brow slapstick school of comedy one refreshing aspect is its lack of mean-spiritedness . the plot follows a group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner ( john cleese ) who must race from vegas to a bus station loc,1

when i saw the trailer for " the sixth sense " i didn't expect much from it . my snap judgment was that it was a watered-down version of " the shining " or possibly a late-entry in the glut of angel-related movies/tv shows of a couple years ago . but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot . it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year . bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe . at the beginning of the movie he is admiring an award the cit,1

trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi-dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter . the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the 60's then cut to the harsh reality of the present . sheffield has become some sort of a semi-slum with the only,1

though it is a fine piece of filmmaking there's something about elizabeth . . . that left me a bit cold and i think it is something that bugs me quite often in films particularly these days ; i just didn't care about the characters . to me the first and foremost job of a filmmaker is to create characters ( be they imagined or historical as the case may be ) that the audience gives a hoot about . and though elizabeth works well on many levels it falls short of excellence because of t,1
as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences . you know the type : his shirt is always shredded his face always scarred he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a " to kill " list for his enemies . oscar-hungry director/executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century . as gibson delivers lines like " before this war is over i am going to kill,1
contrary to the title " the boxer " is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics . it's actually three movies in one : a political film a boxing film and a love story . all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal . we've seen it all before and we're just not blown away with it like we should be . oh well . it's still an exc,1

as a devout atheist and an avowed believer in aliens i have some idea of how ellie aroway ( jodie foster ) feels . but because my reasons for not partaking in religion are different than hers i can't say that i do exactly . her reason is that she needs solid proof : there is no proof that god existed so therefor she does not believe . ellie also believes in aliens and has spent most of her life trying to prove they exist . how can she say she doesn't believe in god because of the lac,1
it's wednesday march 27 and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte south carolina . the crime : a young prostitute elizabeth ( renee zellweger ) has been brutally slain . one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station . the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority miles away . the police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads . at the moment they have only one possible suspect : wa,1
 " desperate measures " was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released : summer '97 . for some reason it was delayed until hollywood's traditional dumping ground : january . now that it's out i see no real reason for that delay as it's a simple yet highly entertaining film . michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who's bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective ( garcia ) . keaton agrees to the,1
scarface a remake of the 1932 film of the same name is a very gripping and as far as i know a true-to-life story of how power and violence lead to corruption . al pacino as tony montana ( for whom the movie is named ) also provides a brilliant performance as a cuban refugee who comes to america with less than nothing and becomes one of the most highly respected and feared drug lords in miami . oliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles . the film b,1
warning : if you actually wish to see the film stop reading this and see it . while i don't blow any plot details the more you know about a movie the more disappointing and built up it becomes ( waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing ) . but in a nutshell it's a good film . star wars episode i : the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world ( i was more into star trek : the next generation ) it is difficult to rel,1
deep rising is one of " those " movies . the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us . it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god . . . screw that it says boldly let's see some computer generated monsters rip into decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors . heh ! them wacky monsters gotta love 'em . of course since we can rent about a thousa,1
 " rebel without a cause " is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to . everyone feels that they are different in some way that they don't belong in some places and " rebel without a cause " successfully shows on screen these universal emotions . no matter what generation you belong to these feelings are present . this is why james dean is admired by america because in this film he represents us,1
when quentin tarantino made " pulp fiction " he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time . but before you send me hate-mail for not giving that title to " citizen kane " hear me out . much like " citizen kane " " pulp fiction " has changed movie making forever . but i think the latter has had a tad more impact . " pulp fiction " has actually ushered in a new era of film making . it has altered th,1
there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason . " good will hunting " is about one of those people . the will hunting of the ( horrible ) title ( let's face it this film would be a bitch to title ) played by co-writer matt damon is a mathematical genius . he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino . and he w,1
maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it's not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker broadcasted on abc on a monday night starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth respectively . because it's not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it's so great . underneath the to-die-for cinematography the brilliant acting and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of mode,1
it's a curious thing - i've found that when willis is not called on to carry the whole movie he's much better and so is the movie . even though in the sixth sense he is the " name " he doesn't have the pivotal role . that honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear ( cute pun seer ) a 9 year old boy who can see ghosts . if osment was cute or precious the director going for the maudlin this would be nothing more than a movie-of-the-week thankfully osment is not only better ,1
i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate cuba's oscar nominee for best foreign film directed by tomas gutierrez alea ( who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo-- " memories of underdevelopment " . i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late '70s ; it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition . i knew then that memorias was prob,1
there's good news and bad news about mulan . the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules . on the other hand the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast . but mulan is a step in the right direction and disney's best animated feature since the lion king . after givin,1
steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits like jurassic park and " oscar " -awarded critical triumphs like schindler's list . however in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories . one of them is close encounters of the third kind extremely popular and influential science-fiction spectacle . unfortunately it had a bad luck to be re,1

for a movie about disco-era excess " 54 " comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club . think of it as a sort of " boogie nights " -lite - where that similarly-structured and -set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings-on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift " 54 " leaves the kinkier details to your imagination . it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter but it thankf,1
until i saw the night of the hunter it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie . forget the others and the deep end ( which veered toward strained dramatics ) the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i've seen so far this year . even though the movie is nearly 50 years old and there's a not drop of blood to be seen . luckily the night of the hunter charles laughton's first and final directing gig has been restored by the ucla film and television ar,1

everyone's heard about this movie and more specifically * the * scene . everyone's heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed ( no pun intended ) over and over . and everyone's got to admit that they will never travel down a river again without thinking of deliverance . good ! that's what you're supposed to do ! oh if you are one of the ones who hasn't seen this yet or you ( somehow ) haven't heard about what happens here's your spoiler warning . deliverance was a real shock,1
this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989 . whether it was the meddling of studio executives or the work of writer/director james cameron himself the original cut of this underwater sci-fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed . the main problem was fairly simple : the film's climax was unworthy of its build-up . someone at 20th century fox - and no doubt cameron himself - must have agreed ,1

the last steve martin film i saw the spanish prisoner was a very different approach for the comic actor . as a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob " a process " from a clueless businessman martin's character did it all for money . in his most recent movie bowfinger martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry . he wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name that will make him ,1
along his carreer mel gibson has collected several successes not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view . for all that i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart . the australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace a popular scotch hero of the 13th century where he would also perform the principal role . accepting so huge challenge mel gibson run the risk of stain all his wor,1
in my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see . i realize that we all have different tastes and i cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike . but in the case of american beauty i must make an exception . if you haven't yet seen it go see it . now . stop reading this review and head for your local multiplex then after you've seen it come back . i'll wait here . welcome back . if you followed my ,1

you don't have to know poker to like " rounders " but it might help . that a great deal of this sharp little drama is set in the back rooms of new york's cardshark underground astoundingly doesn't limit its accessibility even for those who can't tell royal and straight flushes apart .

a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal . a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another . a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain . a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end . if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy the violence continues . it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innoc,1

the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and " real " movies . consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste . top-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety . ,1
probably the most popular and praised film of all time turned out to be a primitive and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism . everyone knows about the greatest and most famous shipping disaster of all time . and the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted by director james cameron combining visual -and sound effects he re-creates the frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship in the middle of nowhere . i liked very much the emotional and brutal contrast between t,1
after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy . this new film has been underrated for no reason . it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla's pervious films . it is also more psychological pessimistic and more tragic than the first two . the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some " unfinished " developments of some characters . the film ele,1

it is with hesitance that i call " apocalypse now " a masterpiece . certainly it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease and some of the finest actors of the 1970's . the plot an adaptation of joseph conrad's " heart of darkness " was set in vietnam and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant coming on the heels of the end of the war .

city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking moving and completely unsentimental . i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality . city of angels is a wonderful film enhanced by interesting and well-rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years . it's a love story that takes the familiar angel themes an,1

 " i know what you did last summer " the first high-profile slasher thriller to be released after 1996's " scream " and written by the same screenwriter kevin williamson is a stylish effective horror film that became 1997's biggest hit of the fall season . while " scream " was a more knowing film about the genre " i know what you did last summer " is more reminiscent of a straight-forward slasher flick but it is far more intelligent than such bottom-of-the-barrel guilty pleasures ,1

i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins separated at birth by divorcing parents never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again . and everyone should know how i feel about remakes especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you're going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both j,1
the premise is simple if not bizarre . a mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average-joe ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made . why ? it's torturous it's maniacal and it's just plain fun . based on the cult-favorite cable television series mystery science theater 3000 : the movie isn't torturous but as for being maniacal and just plain fun it foots the bill qui,1
uncompromising french director robert bresson's " lancelot of the lake " achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory's " morte darthur . " instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them . chivalry has no place in " lancelot of the lake " except as that of a dying ide,1
i can hear the question already . what on earth do these two movies have in common ? to most people not a lot except that both are by renowned directors . as i saw them however both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers . but oh how differently the packages affect their films . while " everyone's " production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special jane campion's imaginative visuals only ser,1

i don't box with kid gloves . i don't play nice i'm not a nice guy and i never ever go easy on a film . i consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic . however i do some favors and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery . rigormortis the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking gets several of these points each time . i still ,1
here is a film that is so unexpected so scary and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . okay it isn't quite original considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species but it certainly is smart . most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s and some even become them . however as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film sometimes expectations can be shattered . a lot of criticism ,1
