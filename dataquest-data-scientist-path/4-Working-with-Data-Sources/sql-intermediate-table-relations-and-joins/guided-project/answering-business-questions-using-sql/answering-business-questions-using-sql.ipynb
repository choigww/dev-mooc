    "## Creating Helper Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SQL fundamentals course we learned how to use python's [SQLite module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) and pandas to write queries that produced dataframe outputs. The advantage of dataframe outputs is that they will display as tables in Jupyter notebook. We can also take advantage of pandas plotting methods to easily create visualizations of our that displayed in tables inside our Jupyter notebook.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we used the `sqlite3.connect()` function to create a connection object, and passed that to the [`pandas.read_sql_query()` function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_sql_query.html). In this project, we'll use a similar approach, with two important changes:\n",
    "* We'll create some helper functions in python to save some time.\n",
    "* We'll use a **context manager** to handle the connection to the SQLite database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context managers make our life easy by taking care of opening and closing the connection to the database, as well as making sure we don't accidentally make changes to the database if one of our queries has an error. If you're interested in learning more about context managers, we recommend [this excellent article by Jeff Knupp](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2016/03/07/python-with-context-managers/). For now, all we need to know is that we'll use [the `with` statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement) to access the [context manager that's built-in to the SQLite module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#using-the-connection-as-a-context-manager):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "with sqlite3.connect('chinook.db') as conn:\n",
    "    # we can now access `conn`\n",
    "    # inside an indented block\n",
    "    query_result = pd.read_sql(my_query, conn)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With a few extra lines, we can turn this code into a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "def run_query(q):\n",
    "    with sqlite3.connect('chinook.db') as conn:\n",
    "        return pd.read_sql(q, conn)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By returning the dataframe, we can just run our function as the last line of a Jupyter cell and it will print the results nicely for us.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also create a function to run SQL queries that don't return tables, like `CREATE VIEW`. In this instance, we don't need to use pandas, we can simply use the SQLite module's [`connection.execute()` method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.execute):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "with sqlite3.connect('chinook.db') as conn:\n",
    "    conn.isolation_level = None\n",
    "    conn.execute(c)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `conn.isolation_level = None` line above tells SQLite to autocommit any changes - we'll talk more about that in the next mission.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we'll make a function that uses our `run_query()` function to return a list of all tables and views in our databases - this is handy to quickly check the state of our database as we work. To make this easier, the query you'll need to use in this function is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    name,\n",
    "    type\n",
    "FROM sqlite_master\n",

    "The Chinook store allows customers to either purchase a whole album, or to purchase one or more individual tracks.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Management are currently considering changing their purchasing strategy to save money. The strategy they are considering is to purchase only the most popular tracks from each album from record companies, instead of purchasing every track from an album.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been asked to find out what percentage of purchases are individual tracks vs whole albums, so that management can use this data to make their decision.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer this question, \n",
    "* we're going to have to identify whether each invoice has all the tracks from an album. \n",
    "  * We can do this by getting the list of tracks from an invoice and comparing it to the list of tracks from an album. \n",
    "  * We can find the album to compare the purchase to by looking up the album that one of the purchased tracks belongs to. \n",
    "  * It doesn't matter which track we pick, since if it's an album purchase, that album will be the same for all tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, we've only ever compared two single values, using operators like `=` `!=` and `LIKE`. \n",

    "We want to find a way to compare the `letters` columns from `test_table_2` and `test_table_3` to `test_table_1` to see if they are contain all of the same values as `test_table_1`. Let's use `EXCEPT` and see what we get with the first two tables:\n",
