Robust and popular DBMS tools like [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) include powerful features for managing user credentials, security, and high data throughput (quickly changing data). In this course and the next, we'll learn the fundamentals of SQL using a small, portable DBMS called [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/). SQLite is the most popular database in the world and is lightweight enough that the SQLite DBMS is included as a [module in Python](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/sqlite3.html).
