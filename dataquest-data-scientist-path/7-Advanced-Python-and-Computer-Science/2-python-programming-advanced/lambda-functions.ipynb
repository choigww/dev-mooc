    "In this mission, we'll dive into string manipulation, which is essential to working with data that's represented as text. Similar to a list, string objects are indexed so we can access specific characters quickly. If we want to access the first character in `my_string`, we write `my_string[0]`, just like we would to get the first element in a list.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the index to **slice** string objects, or select the fragments we want and pull them out. When we slice a string, we select a chunk or **substring** from the original string. To select a specific character, we only need to specify one number -- the character's index. When **slicing** a string, we specify a range of values for the indices instead of just a single number.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want the first four characters in a string, for example, what we're really asking for are the characters from index `0` to index `3` (**inclusive**) of the string. To represent ranges in Python, we would specify the starting index as `0`, but the ending index as `4`. Python uses the ending index to stop iterating and doesn't return the character at index `4`; this is one of the language's quirks! If we want the characters from index `2` to index `5` (**inclusive**), we would need to specify `2` as the starting index and `6` as the ending index, rather than `5`.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent ranges, we still use bracket notation like before. Now we specify two numbers though -- the starting index and the ending indexâ€”and separate them with a colon. If we want the first four characters of the string object `my_string`, for example, we write:<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that you got a taste of slicing, let's explore some other ways we would want to select a substring from a string. What if we want to select every odd character in a string? Specifically, how do we select all of the characters at indices `1`, `3`, `5`, and so on? With what we know so far, we would have to iterate through every character and throw away all of the even characters. Alternatively, we could create a list with just the odd indices, and write a for loop to iterate and select only the characters at those indices. Thankfully, there's a simpler way!<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can enter a third number in our range that controls the distance between each character we want to select. This value is known as the **step** value, which is `1` by default. Let's see how we can use that functionality to select all of the characters in `password` that have odd indices.\n",

    "The slice `[1:8:2]` specifies that we want to start the substring at index `1`, and add `2` to the index each time until it observes or exceeds index `8`. Therefore, the string object odds should be set to the value \"asod\", which correspond to the four characters at indices `1`, `3`, `5`, and `7`. If we didn't provide a step value, the interpreter would have defaulted to `1` and odds would contain all of the characters beginning at index 1, instead of just the ones at odd indices.<br>\n",

    "By similar logic, `password[0:6:4]` would result in `\"pw\"`. We would start at index `0`, extract `\"p\"`, step to index `4`, and finally extract `\"w\"`. If we step again, the index would be at `8`, which is beyond our ending index of `6`.<br>\n",

On the last screen, for example, we wrote the `is_palindrome()` function, but only used it once. Because the logic for `is_palindrome()` only consisted of one line, it would have been more convenient to write and apply the logic only when we needed it (when we executed the `filter()` function).<br>\n",

    "Passing a lambda function into another function is similar to passing a value into a function, rather than a variable. Instead of referring to our function by name (for instance, `my_func()`), we're simply passing the function in as a raw value. This is analogous to passing in `\"hello world\"` instead of `my_string`. It can take a while to get used to the idea of functions as values, but the concept is very powerful. Lets look at a more detailed example.\n",
