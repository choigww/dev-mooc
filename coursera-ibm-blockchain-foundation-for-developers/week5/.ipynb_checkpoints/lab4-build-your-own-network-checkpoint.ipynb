    "byfn.sh -h|--help (print this message)\n",
    "  -m <mode> - one of 'up', 'down', 'restart' or 'generate'\n",
    "    - 'up' - bring up the network with docker-compose up\n",
    "    - 'down' - clear the network with docker-compose down\n",
    "    - 'restart' - restart the network\n",
    "    - 'generate' - generate required certificates and genesis block\n",
    "  -c <channel name> - channel name to use (defaults to \"mychannel\")\n",
    "  -t <timeout> - CLI timeout duration in seconds (defaults to 10000)\n",
    "  -d <delay> - delay duration in seconds (defaults to 3)\n",
    "  -f <docker-compose-file> - specify which docker-compose file use (defaults to docker-compose-cli.yaml)\n",
    "  -s <dbtype> - the database backend to use: goleveldb (default) or couchdb\n",
    "  -l <language> - the chaincode language: golang (default) or node\n",
    "\n",
    "  Typically, one would first generate the required certificates and\n",
