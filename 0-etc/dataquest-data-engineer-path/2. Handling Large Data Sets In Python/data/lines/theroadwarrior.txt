 GEORGE MILLER BRIAN HANNANT
 The vision dims and all that remains are mememories.  They take me back - back to the place where the black pump sucked guzzolene from the earth...
 And I remember the terrible battle we fought - the day we left that place forever...
 But, most of all, I remember the courage of a stranger, a road warrior called Max.  To understand who he was you must go back to the last days of the old world ...
 ...  when, for reasons long forgotten, two mighty warrior nations went to war ...
 ...and touched off a blaze which engulfed them all.
 ...For without fuel they were nothing.  They had built a house of straw ...
 Sell!  Sell!  Sell!
 "Fueling The World"
 Stage three of the national emergency is effective immediately, citizens are warned ...
 People stopped in the streets and listened:  for the first time they heard the sound of silence.
 Their world crumbled ...
 And only those mobile enough to scavenge, brutal enough to pillage would survive.
 At last, the vermin had inherited the earth.
 And in this maelstrom of decay, ordinary men were battered and crushed...
 ...men like the Warrior Max...
 who in the roar of an engine, lost everything ...
 And became a shell of a man.  A burnt out, desolate man, a dead man, running from the demons of his past. A man who wandered far away...
 And it was out here in this blighted place, that he learned to live again...
 Don't hurt that snake!
 Put him back...  gently!
 Sounded like a big V-8 to me.  I guess I got myself some guzzolene.
 The car's booby-trapped.  Touch those tanks and BOOM!  You'll blow yourself apart.
 Drop the weapons...  Now back up.
 You're quick, I'll give you that. Never seen a man beat a snake. Never.  Reflexes, that's what you've got.  Me?  I've got brains.
 Now, where's this booby-trap?
 A fella - a quick fella - might keep a weapon under there.
 Then I'd have to pin his head to the panel.
 There's one more.
 Oh no!  You don't play me the fool.
 Gas!  Petrol!  Guzzolene!  Listen! Hundreds...  thousands of gallons... as much as you want ...
 Where?
 Not far.  Ten...  maybe twenty miles.  Pumping it they are. Refining it.  Kachunk...  kachunk... kachunk...  Day and night.  A huge tanker full.
 Balls!
 It's there, you betcha...  I'll tell you straight though - it's not self service.  It's under guard.  Too hard for me.  But a man with your ingenuity ...  Jesus I reckon...
 Where?
 Kill me, and you'll never find out.
 Well...  I never said it'd be easy.
 Okay, there it is.  If anyone can get.  in, I know it's gonna be you. Me ...  I've gotta feed the snakes.
 A man lives by his word, I reckon. And I've kept mine ...
 Look!  We had a deal:  I show you the gas - You let me go.
 The contract was I wouldn't kill you.
 I reckon you got a bargain...  Don't you?
 What's up!!
 Jesus!  He's gonna kill her.
 Hey!  What about me?!!
 Thank you.  Thank you...
 Let's get this straight.  I'm doing it 'cos I need fuel.
 As much as you want.  Take me back ...  don't let me die.
 Stay alive!  Stay alive!
 Nathan!  Nathan!  It's Nathan.
 Nathan!  God have mercy..  What a waste.
 Look at your handiwork!  They didn't have a chance ...
 You all heard me.  I warned him didn't I?  Madness, I said.
 Pity your name wasn't pulled out the hat.
 We can escape, take our petrol, he said.  How?  I said.  Get a prime mover, he said ...
 ...  And there's the result! Madness I said!
 Where did you find him?
 Two, three miles away...  left for dead...  next to his car.  We made a deal.
 Three other vehicles.  Did you see them?
 Running hard to the south-west.  In heaps of trouble.  Listen:  he said if I brought him in, you'd give me gas.  There's no time...
 There was a woman...  in the car ...
 She's dead.
 How?  What did they do?
 It was quick.
 I saw a man in trouble and I brought him in.  And now I just want to get out of here.  Give me my gas.
 For all we know, he's one of them. Give him nothing.
 We had a contract...
 I don't know who you are, or what happened.  But if you had a contract, it was with him.  And it died with him.
 Be thankful, you're still alive.
 I gotta hand it to you.  Some machine...
 Would've been a shame to blow it up. The last of the pursuit specials. It's history, that's what it is.  A piece of history...
 It's OK, Dog.  Just do as they say...
 Hold your fire.  He wants to talk... he comes in peace...  for Godsake! Hold your fire...
 Poor mongrels ...  not one got through.
 Greetings from the Lord Humungus The Warrior of the Wasteland!  The Ayatollah of Rock and Roller.
 I am told you wish to take the gasolene out of the wasteland...
 Shoot!  Shoot him!  While you've got the chance ...
 You set out this morning to find a vehicle.  A vehicle strong enough to haul that fat tank of gas ...
 You see!  There is no escape.  The Humungus rules the wasteland...
 Don't give them the gas!  Blow it up!
 I got it!  I got it!
 There's been enough talk.  I'm going in!
 Be still my dog of war.  I understand your pain.  We've all lost someone we love ...  But, we do it my way.  Fear is our ally. After, you can have your revenge.
 There has been too much violence ... too much pain.  None here is without sin.  But, I have an honourable compromise.  Give me the gasoline and I'll spare your lives.  Just walk away.  I will give you safe passage in the wasteland ...  Walk away and there will be an end to the horror ...
 You have one full day to decide!!
 We'll never walk away.  Never!
 Don't be a fool!  It's our only chance...
 It's simple ...  we trade the gas for our lives.
 No!  We've worked too hard.
 Walk out there?  They'd slaughter us...  run us down for sport.
 Don't listen to them!  It's bad enough the lunatics are running the asylum.  Don't let them throw away the key.
 It'll be alright.  I'll talk to this Humungus.  He'd never hurt an asthmatic old man.
 I'm sure they'll find a use for you.
 I'd rather be out there, on my back alive, than in here, on my back dead.
 He promised us safe passage.  He gave his word.
 And let us suppose he keeps it ...
 ...and we walk out of here with our lives.  What then?  Do we wander the wasteland - scavenging.  Wake up one morning and find we're just like them - savages.
 Is that what you want?  I don't.  I came out here and I found that pump. I built that plant and ploughed that field.  Why?  Because we are human beings.  We must maintain our dignity.  We are not barbarians ...
 I made one mistake - I waited too long...  thinking we could survive here.  We can't.  But, as frightened as we all are let's not forget one thing.
 That is more than just a tank of fuel.  It's our lifeline, our passport to a place beyond the reach of men on machines.
 No!  I don't know how we're gonna get there.  But the first step is to defend that fuel.  I won't surrender it to anyone.  I stay!  Alone if I have to...
 Words!  Just words.  You're going to die, for a pipedream.
 No!  We fight for a belief - I stay!
 I really wished it had worked.  I'm sorry.
 We stay!
 Two days ago I saw a vehicle that'd haul that tanker.
 You wanna get out of here.  You talk to me.
 So that's my offer.  I deliver a prime mover and in return you give me my black car and as much gas as I can carry.  All I need right now is three Jerry cans of diesel and five gallons of petroleum.
 Think of it as a down payment.
 And that's the last we'll ever see of him.
 What have we got to lose?
 I knew it.  I knew it'd work. Lethal, those snakes.  Lethal.  Born killers.  The snake's fangs, my brains.  Lethal I tell ya ...
 Don't think you're gonna get any of this.  Cos you're not.  It was my snake.  I found it.  I trained it. And I'm gonna eat it.
 You mean?  All this time?  Jesus, that's dishonest!
 How do we know that one's not a dud.
 There's only one way to find out.
 What sort of deals that?!  I'm running on empty!
 You can't just dump me!  Think of us as partners.
 It's up to you.  Fly a kite, or follow me back.  Maybe they'll throw some gas your way.
 What sort of deal's that?!  I'm running on empty!
 Watch your tyres!  Turn left!
 Open the gate!
 The gate's open!  Follow me in!
 Don't lose it now! We need the fuel!
 The gate!  The gate!  Move!!
 OK!  OK!  Let's go.  We leave tonight!
 We got a hole through the radiator - into the timing case.  Gonna take at least 24 hours.
 You've got twelve.
 I want you to know...  that was a very brave thing you did...
 ...  and tell me, son, this machine of yours - it takes two ...  does it?
 er...  possibly.
 See!  I told ya.  I said he was leaving.
 I don't have time for thanks.  You know what you did out there and what it means to us.  Come with us, MAX. Drive the tanker.
 We had a contract.  I did my job, I got my car and I got my gas.  End of story.
 It doesn't have to be - we'll make a new contract.  I can offer you a chance to rebuild your life.  I can offer you a future.
 You gotta come.  Look!
 SUNSHINE COAST
 This is where we're going.  Two thousand miles away.  Bloody paradise.  Fresh water...  plenty of sunshine...  nothing to do but breed...
 What are you looking for out there? How long do you expect to survive, scavenging day to day?  You're no different from them...
 ...  vultures, maggots.  Don't you see? There is a better way!
 Yeah.  I tried it once!  Now forget it, 'cos I never get involved.  I'm leaving.  I leave tonight.
 You see!  That's the alternative! Men feeding on men.
 I know you're afraid darlin'...  But I'll let you into a secret, sweetheart.  I'm afraid too.
 Co on!  Go!  Just another mercenary!
 I just want you to know that I don't agree with them.
 I don't think you're a coward.  A bit stupid maybe - but not a coward. Where else you gonna find what we've got here?  Food...  fuel ...  clean women.
 Men, too, if that's your inclination.  Jesus!  All we've got to do is get away from that Humungus.  With you driving the tanker, we can do it!  I know you can.  I saw you out there.  Stay with us Max.  Drive the tanker.
 I haven't got time to explain.  Just believe me - I've got everything I want.
 Good luck tomorrow.  I hope you make it.
 Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
 Get out.  Scat!  Go back.
 You're a fine kid, but you can't come.  You've gotta learn - don't get close to people.  It can churn you up ...
 Don't waste him.  If he's alive... I want him.
 It's defensible.  We can refuel there.
 But!  Only give us until sunset.  If we haven't made it by then, keep going!
 I'll drive the tanker ...
 Until you're clear of trouble ...
 He's gotta be joking!
 Look at you.
 But I'm still the best you've got.
 You'll need these ...
 I sweated blood on this mother.  And no bastard's gonna make me go in no lousy bread van.
 The tanker!  All on the tanker!
 No!  The other way!!
 Get back!  For Chrissakes!
 Jump!  It's finished.  Jump!
 Jump!
 The Kid?!
 Forget it!  Jump!
 All this and no guzzolene.
 I know where there's guzzolene.
 We've done it!  I thought it'd be impossible.  But we've done it!!
 What about the Kid?!
 We've won!  Don't you see?  The fuel was with the others.  It's already at Powder River.
 What happened to the boy?!
 We've gotta keep going.  It's our only chance.
 The Kid?
 I had to leave him...  he was pinned to the rig...
 You left him there?  With them? Alive?
 There was nothing I could do.
 Pappagallo led us north...  to safety - to a place in the sun... In the tenth year, nurturing his vision of a new world, he died felling timber.
 The Captain and the Girl waged war for years...  together they raised eight children....  And as for me...
 ...  in the fullness of time, I became the leader - the chief of the Great Northern Tribe...
 As for the Road Warrior...  That was the last we ever saw of him.  He lives now...  Only in our memories...
