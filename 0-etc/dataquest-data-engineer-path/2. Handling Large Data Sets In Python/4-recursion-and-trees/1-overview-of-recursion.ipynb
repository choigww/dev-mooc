    "In the past few courses, you have been learning about different data structures and their respective algorithms. We have been describing how to efficiently search and update these structures but there has always been a trade off between the two. In this course we will be developing a data structure that will have both fast search and *efficient* updates.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we are at a crossroads now where **developing this new data structure will require a new way of thinking**. This type of thinking is called **recursion**. You may have encountered this topic in an earlier mission.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that recursion is commonly defined as **a function that calls itself**. This backwards way of thinking takes some time to sink in but you'll soon notice that many algorithms and structures you come up with can naturally be defined this way. Recursion doesn't just happen in programming though, there are examples of it even in art!\n",

    "\n",
    "You may have also encountered recursion even in real life. Think about a time when you have ridden an elevator with mirrors on both sides. The mirrors reflect each other and it looks like they keep going on forever.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice though, we don't want our algorithms to keep going on forever. To stop recursion from continuing to infinity, we need to have some **terminating case** that will make sure it eventually stops. You can think of the terminating case as the statement `break` in a `while True` loop.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you learn this shift in thinking, it can be incredibly valuable when trying to come up with unique solutions to problems. By the end of this mission you will learn how to implement your own recursive algorithms."

    "The best way to understand recursion is to actually work with recursion. The shift from an iterative thinking to a recursive thought space will take some time but it's best to learn with examples.

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break this recursive implementation down a bit. The `if` case on the third line is the terminating case. To see why this is a terminating case, take a look at the `return` statement.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we return the first integer in the list and then add the function itself. This is what we meant earlier by a function that calls itself. We slice the list after the first element and then call the function again with a list reduced by one.<br>\n",

    "The list will keep getting reduced with every call until there is only one element left; the terminating case. Once we return the final element, the function will keep on returning itself until the total sum is returned.<br>\n",

We mentioned that the function will both call and return itself and this managed internally by the Python interpreter's use of memory.

If we start dividing them all into half, we keep cutting the lists into smaller chunks spread equally apart after every recursive call in the algorithm. If you were to add the total work done for a single step in the recursion algorithm, notice that it is actually `O(n)` work. Where `n` is the size of the unsorted list.\n",
