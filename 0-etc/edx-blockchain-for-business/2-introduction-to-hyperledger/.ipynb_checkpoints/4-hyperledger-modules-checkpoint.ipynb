    "For businesses that want to deploy **Blockchain-as-a-Service**, [Hyperledger Cello](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/cello) provides a toolkit that fulfills this need. **Particularly for lean businesses and small enterprises**, who want to reduce or eliminate the effort required in creating, managing, and terminating blockchains, Hyperledger Cello allows blockchains deployment to the cloud. \n",

Hyperledger Cello was initially contributed by IBM, with sponsors from Soramitsu, Huawei, and Intel.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Application developers and system administrators using Cello can provision and maintain Hyperledger networks. For instance, you can create a group of distributed ledger networks in virtual clouds known as 'container clusters', and then, manage and monitor those networks with a configurable dashboard. Additionally, you can build a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform.\n",
