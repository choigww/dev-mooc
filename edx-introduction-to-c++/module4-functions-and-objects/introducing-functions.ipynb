A function is essentially a block of C++ code that you give a name and then call from other locations in your application, when you want the computer to perform the instructions contained in that function.<br>\n",

    "You create a function by defining it.  The function definition may contain a return type, a function name, parameters to accept incoming arguments, and finally a body which contains the code that will execute as part of that function.  Functions may or may not return a value back to the caller and they may or may not accept arguments passed in to the function.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When you move into more advanced C++ programming, you can also overload functions.  This refers to the practice of using the same function name to refer to multiple functions that perform different actions.  Why would you do this?  Consider a simple scenario where you want to perform addition on some values so you create a function called Sum().  You could overload Sum() by creating variants such as:"
