    "C++ is **a case sensitive language**. Case sensitivity means that\n",
    "* **your keywords and variable declarations must match the case**. \n",
    "  * For example, a C++ keyword for a constant type is **`const`**. If you were to type **`Const` or `CONST`, the compiler would not know** that your intention was to use the keyword `const`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from the case sensitivity, C++ also has a defined outline for program code and specific \"elements\" found in a typical C++ application. These elements consist of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Preprocessor directives** which are used to have the compiler execute tasks prior to compiling the source code\n",
    "  * using directives which are utilized **to indicate which namespaces to include in a source code file**\n",
    "* **a function header** which consists of a *return type, function name, and parameters*\n",
    "* **a function body** containing the code that performs the actions required of that function\n",
    "* **statements** that are contained in the C++ source code file\n",
    "* **comments** for documenting the source code for programmers to understand what the code is intended to do\n",
    "* **a return statement** that sends data back to the function caller\n",
    "* **curly braces** to enclose bodies of statements. Commonly used to denote the body of a function or a flow controls statement such as a for loop\n",
    "\n",
    "C++ source code also **permits judicious use of white space (tabs, spaces, new lines) to create code that is easier to read**. The compiler completely ignores the white space, with a small exception concerning if statements that will be covered later. \n",
    "* It is highly recommended that you make use of white space to indent and separate lines of code to aid in readability of your source code files.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Unlike Python, indenting lines after the for statement does not tell the compiler to execute those indented lines as part of the for statement. In C++, multiple statements for a single for statement, must be enclosed in curly braces. This will be covered more in Module 3, Control Statements."

    "A C++ program is comprised of various **components such as functions, methods, classes, etc**. The instructions that form part of a C++ program typically reside inside of functions or methods. These functions are comprised of C++ statements. You will find yourself using various types of statements in your C++ code as listed here:\n",
