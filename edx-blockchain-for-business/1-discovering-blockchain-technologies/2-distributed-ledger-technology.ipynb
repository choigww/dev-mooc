    "## Background - The Rising Interest in Distributed Ledger Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking back to the last half century of computer technologies and architectures, one may observe **a trend of fluctuation between the centralization and subsequent decentralization of computing power, storage, infrastructure, protocols, and code**.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Mainframe computers are largely **centralized**. They typically **house all computing power, memory, data storage, and code**. Access to mainframes is mainly by 'dumb terminals', which only take inputs and outputs, and do not store or process data.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "With the advent of personal computers and private networks, **similar computational capabilities were now housed both on the clients, as well as the servers. This, in part, gave rise to the 'client-server' architecture, which supported the development of relational database systems.** Massive data sets, which are housed on mainframes, could move onto a distributed architecture. This data could replicate from server to server, and subsets of the data could be accessed and processed on clients, and then, synced back to the server.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, Internet and cloud computing architectures enabled global access from a variety of computing devices; whereas mainframes were largely designed to address the needs of large corporations and governments. **Even though this 'cloud architecture' is decentralized in terms of hardware, it has given rise to application-level centralization** (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we are witnessing the transition from centralized computing, storage, and processing to decentralized architectures and systems. According to [Muneeb Ali](https://medium.com/@muneeb/the-next-wave-of-computing-743295b4bc73), these systems aim to\n",

    "> \"When people say that blockchains are immutable, they don't mean that the data can't be changed, they mean it is extremely hard to change without collusion, and if you try, it's extremely easy to detect the attempt.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dig into this statement a bit further. **It is extremely hard to change the transactions in a blockchain, because each block is linked to the previous block by including the previous block's hash**. This hash includes the Merkle root hash of all the transactions in the previous block. If a single transaction were to change, not only would the Merkle root hash change, but so too would the hash contained in the changed block. In addition, each subsequent block would need to be updated to reflect this change. In the case of proof of work, the amount of energy required to recalculate the nonce for this block and each subsequent block would be prohibitive. On the other hand, if someone did modify a transaction in a block without going through the necessary steps to update the subsequent blocks, it would be easy to recalculate the hashes used in the blocks and determine that something is amiss.<br>\n",

    "Let's look at an example of how this works. In the following diagram, we see the original blocks and the transactions for Block 11. Specifically, we see that the Merkle root for the transactions in Block 11 is **`Hash #ABCD`**, which is the combined hash for the four transactions in this block. Now, let's say that someone comes in and attempts to change Transaction A to Transaction A'. This, in turn, modifies the hashes that are stored in the Merkle tree, and the Merkle root changes to **`Hash #A'BCD`**. In addition, the Previous Block hash stored in Block 12 also needs to be modified to reflect the overall change in the hash for Block 11.\n",
