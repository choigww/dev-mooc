    "### Peers\n",
    "Peers maintain the state of the network and a copy of the ledger. There are two different types of peers: **endorsing** and **committing** peers. However, there is an overlap between endorsing and committing peers, in that **endorsing peers are a special kind of committing peers**. All peers commit blocks to the distributed ledger.\n",

These RW sets capture what was read from the current world state while simulating the transaction, as well as what would have been written to the world state had the transaction been executed. These RW sets are then signed by the endorsing peer, and returned to the client application to be used in future steps of the transaction flow.\n",
