    "## Chaincode\n",
    "\n",
    "In Hyperledger Fabric, **chaincode** is the 'smart contract' that runs on the peers and creates transactions. More broadly, it enables users to create transactions in the Hyperledger Fabric network's shared ledger and update the world state of the assets.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Chaincode is programmable code, written in Go, and instantiated on a channel. Developers use chaincode to develop business contracts, asset definitions, and collectively-managed decentralized applications. The chaincode manages the ledger state through transactions invoked by applications. Assets are created and updated by a specific chaincode, and cannot be accessed by another chaincode.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications interact with the blockchain ledger through the chaincode. Therefore, the chaincode needs to be installed on every peer that will endorse a transaction and instantiated on the channel.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to develop smart contracts with Hyperledger Fabric:\n",
    "* **Code individual contracts** into standalone instances of chaincode\n",
    "* (More efficient way) **Use chaincode to create decentralized applications** that manage the lifecycle of one or multiple types of business contracts, and **let the end users instantiate instances of contracts within these applications**."

    "An important interface that you can use when writing your chaincode is defined by Hyperledger Fabric - [ChaincodeStub](https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim#Chaincode) and [ChaincodeStubInterface](https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim#ChaincodeStub). The ChaincodeStub provides functions that allow you to **interact with the underlying ledger to query, update, and delete assets**. The key APIs for chaincode include:\n",
    "* `func (stub *ChaincodeStub) GetState(key string) ([]byte, error)`\n",
    "  * Returns the value of the specified key from the ledger. Note that GetState doesn't read data from the Write set, which has not been committed to the ledger. In other words, **`GetState` doesn't consider data modified by PutState that has not been committed**. If the key does not exist in the state database, `(nil, nil)` is returned.\n",
    "* `func (stub *ChaincodeStub) PutState(key string, value []byte) error`\n",
    "  * Puts the specified key and value **into the transaction's Write set as a data-write proposal**. `PutState` doesn't affect the ledger **until the transaction is validated and successfully committed**.\n",
    "* `func (stub *ChaincodeStub) DelState(key string) error`\n",
    "  * Records the specified key to be deleted in the Write set of the transaction proposal. **The key and its value will be deleted from the ledger when the transaction is validated and successfully committed**."
