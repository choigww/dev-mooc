    "## Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the key components of Hyperledger Iroha, it is important to get an overarching look at this framework. The diagram below shows a layered architectural view of the different components that make up Hyperledger Iroha. The four layers are: API, Peer Interaction, Chain Business Logic, and Storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "![iroha-architecture](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/cb033d180ecb4eb288f2f0a489195e6c/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS171x+3T2017+type@asset+block/Iroha-architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The components are:\n",
    "* **Model** classes are system entities.\n",
    "* **Torii**(gate) provides the input and output interfaces for clients. It is a single gRPC server that is used by clients to interact with peers through the network. The client's RPC call is *non-blocking*, making Torii an *asynchronous* server. Both commands (transactions) and queries (read access) are performed through this interface.\n",
    "* **Network** encompasses interaction with the network of peers.\n",
    "* **Consensus** is in charge of peers agreeing on chain content in the network. The consensus mechanism used by Iroha is YAC (Yet Another Consensus), which is a practical byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm based on voting for block hash.\n",
    "* **Simulator** generates a temporary snapshot of storage to validate transactions by executing them against this snapshot and forming a verified proposal, which consists only of valid transactions.\n",
    "* **Validator** classes check business rules and validity (correct format) of transactions or queries. There are two distinct types of validation that occur in Hyperledger Iroha:\n",
    "  - **Stateless validation** is a quicker form of validation, that performs schema and signature checks of the transaction.\n",
    "  - **Stateful validation** is a slower form of validation, that checks the permissions and the current world state view, which is the latest and most actual state of the chain, to see if desired business rules and policies are possible. For example, does an account have enough funds to transfer?\n",
    "* **Synchronizer** helps to synchronize new peers in the system or temporarily disconnected peers.\n",
    "* **Ametsuchi** is the ledger block storage which consists of a block index (currently Redis), block store (currently flat files), and a world state view component (currently PostgreSQL)."

    "  * **a**. **Query** data that they have access/permission to\n",

    "* **Peers** maintain the current state and their own copy of the shared ledger. A peer is a single entity in the network, and has an address, identity, and trust. \n",
    "  * Hyperledger Iroha is designed so that a single peer may be a single computer or scaled for a cluster, meaning different computers are used for ledger storage, indices, validation, and peer-to-peer logic.\n",
    "* **Ordering service** orders transactions into a known order. There are a few options for the algorithm used by the ordering service. Kafka is considered a good candidate. \n",
    "  * It is important to mention that **if Kafka, or any other distributed solution is used, that it be clustered;** \n",
