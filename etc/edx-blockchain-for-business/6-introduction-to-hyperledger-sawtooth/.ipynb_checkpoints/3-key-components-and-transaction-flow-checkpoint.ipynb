    "\n",
    "Hyperledger Sawtooth **transaction batches** are clusters of transactions that are either all committed to state together, or none of the transactions are committed at all. As a result, transaction batches are often described as an atomic unit of change, since a group of transactions are treated as one, and are committed to the state as one. Every single transaction in Hyperledger Sawtooth is submitted within a batch. Batches can contain as little as a single transaction.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When a transaction is created by a client, the batch is submitted to the validator (which we will cover more in depth in the next section). Transactions are organized into a batch in the order they are intended to be committed. The validator then, in turn, applies each transaction within the batch, leading to a change in the global state. The batch is committed to the state. If one transaction within the batch is invalid, then none of the transactions within that batch are committed.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, transaction batching allows a group of transactions to be applied in a specific order, and if any are invalid, then none of the transactions are applied.

    "## How Proof of Elapsed Time Works\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, each validator within the network requests a wait time from an enclave, or a trusted function. This is where the 'Elapsed Time' comes into play. The validator with the shortest wait time for a specific block is appointed the leader, and creates the block to be committed to the ledger. As a result, a truly random leader is elected, and the amount of power or type of hardware you have will not give you an advantage. Using simple functions, the network can verify that the winning validator did indeed 'win', by proving that it had the shortest time to wait before assuming the leadership position.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof of Elapsed Time is revolutionary in its ability to achieve distributed consensus using a lottery function. This not only allows for easy verification and fairness within the network, but also for incredible scalability. Without the heavy costs of participating in consensus, anyone can participate in the network. One of Hyperledger Sawtooth's main advantages is that it allows the size of the network to scale. That is, Hyperledger Sawtooth is nearly limitless in the network size it can support."
