    "# Significance Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll learn about hypothesis testing and statistical significance. A hypothesis is a pattern or rule about a process in the world that can be tested. We use hypothesis testing to determine if a change we made had a meaningful impact or not. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use hypothesis testing to help you determine:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **if a new banner ad on a website caused a meaningful drop in the user engagement**,\n",
    "* **if raising the price of a product caused a meaningful drop in sales**,\n",
    "* **if a new weight loss pill helped people lose more weight.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Observing a decrease in user engagement or sales after instituting a change doesn't automatically imply that the change was the cause. Hypothesis testing allows us to calculate the probability that random chance was actually responsible for the difference in outcome. Every process has some inherent amount of randomness that we can't measure and understanding the role of chance helps us reach a conclusion that's more likely to be correct.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We first set up a **null hypothesis** that describes the status quo. We then state an **alternative hypothesis**, which we used to compare with the null hypothesis to decide which describes the data better. In the end, we either need to:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis or\n",
    "* accept the null hypothesis and reject the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can frame each of the studies above as these rival pairs of hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "* if a new banner ad on a website caused a meaningful drop in the user engagement:\n",
    "\n",
    "hypothesis|desc\n",
    "---|---\n",
    "null|users who were exposed to the banner ad spent the same amount of time on the website than those who weren't.\n",
    "alternative|users who were exposed to the banner ad spent less time on the website than those who weren't.\n",
    "\n",
    "* if raising the price of a product caused a meaningful drop in sales:\n",
    "\n",
    "hypothesis|desc\n",
    "---|---\n",
    "null|the number of purchases of the product was the same at the lower price than it was at the higher price.\n",
    "alternative|the number of purchases of the product was lower at the higher price than it was at the lower price.\n",
    "\n",
    "* if a new weight loss pill helped people lose more weight:\n",
    "\n",
    "hypothesis|desc\n",
    "---|---\n",
    "null|patients who went on the weight loss pill lost no more weight than those who didn't.\n",
    "alternative|patients who went on the weight loss pill lost more weight than those who didn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this mission, we'll focus on the third scenario and use data to determine if a weight loss pill helped people lose weight."

    "## Research design\n",
    "\n",
    "To help us determine if the weight loss pill was effective, we conducted a study where we invited 100 volunteers and split them into 2 even groups randomly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Group A was given a placebo, or fake, pill and instructed to consume it on a daily basis.\n",
    "* Group B was given the actual weight loss pill and instructed to consume it on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both groups were instructed to change nothing else about their diets. Group A is referred to as the control group while group B is referred to as the treatment group. This type of study is called a [blind experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment) since the participants didn't know which pill they were receiving. This helps us reduce the potential bias that is introduced when participants know which pill they were given. For example, participants who are aware they were given the weight loss pill may try to add healthier foods to their diet to help them lose more weight. Both groups were weighed before the study began and a month later, after the study ended.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the **research design** for a study is an important first step that informs the rest of your analysis. It helps us uncover potential flaws in the study that we need to keep in mind as we dive deeper. The weight loss pill study we conducted is known as an experimental study. Experimental studies usually involve bringing in participants, instructing them to perform some tasks, and observing them. A key part of running an experimental study is random assignment, which involves assigning participants in the study to random groups without revealing which group each participant is in. Before exploring and analyzing a dataset, it's important to understand how the study was conducted. Flaws in how the study was run can lead you to reach the wrong conclusions."

    "## Statistical significance\n",

    "Statistics helps us determine if the difference in the weight lost between the 2 groups is because of random chance or because of an actual difference in the outcomes. If there is a meaningful difference, we say that the results are **statistically significant**. We'll dive into what this means exactly over the course of this mission.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we're familiar with the study, let's state our null and alternative hypotheses more precisely. Our null hypothesis should describe the default position of skepticism, which is that there's no statistically significant difference between the outcomes of the 2 groups. Put another way, it should state that any difference is due to random chance. Our alternative hypothesis should state that there is in fact a statistically significant difference between the outcomes of the 2 groups.<br>\n",
