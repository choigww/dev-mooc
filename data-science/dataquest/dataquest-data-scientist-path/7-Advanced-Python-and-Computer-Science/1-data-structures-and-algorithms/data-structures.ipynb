    "We can't fully understand a data structure without first analyzing its time complexity. 2D arrays are tricky though. We haven't really discussed whether we can expand our 2D array, and even if we could, the process would be awkward.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, let's make a few assumptions about the 2D arrays we're using. \n",
    "* First and foremost, let's assume they're **static**. In other words, **their size does not change**. \n",
    "* Another simplifying assumption that follows is that insertion into our 2D arrays simply replaces whatever element was there, and that **deletion leaves an \"empty\" slot in the array**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only interesting complexity analysis involves accessing elements of a 2D array. Since deletion and insertion replace elements, their complexities will be the same as array access because we always have to find the element we're dealing with first.<br>\n",

    "Accessing by index is constant time because we're really dealing with an array of arrays. Accessing the row is constant time because the row is just an element in a regular array. Then, accessing the element within that row is constant time again. Nothing depends on the size of the array, so it's constant time.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider searching for an element (accessing by value). Let's call the height of our array `m`, and the width `n`. Behind the scenes, we're really working with an array of size `m`, where each element in the array is an array of size `n`. This is simply the array-of-arrays implementation we discussed earlier.<br>\n",

Because the array is `m` rows by `n` columns, there are `m * n` total slots. We touch each slot once, so our time complexity is **O(m * n)**.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks a bit different than the time complexities we've seen before, but we need to remember what time complexity represents.

When two keys map to the same index, we have a **collision**. We want to avoid collisions.<br>\n",
