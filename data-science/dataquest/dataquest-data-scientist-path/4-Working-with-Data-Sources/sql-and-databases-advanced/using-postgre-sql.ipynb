    "# Using PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've been using a database engine called [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/). SQLite is one of the most common database engines, and has many advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The database is stored in a single file, making it portable.\n",
    "* You can use a SQLite database directly from Python, and don't need a separate program running.\n",
    "* It implements most SQL commands, enabling you to use most of the statements you're familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### However, particularly when developing larger applications, SQLite has a few downsides that make other database engines more attractive:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Only one process at a time can write to the database**. When you have a complex web application, you may have multiple processes updating information in the database at the same time. For example, on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), one process might handle updating user information, and another might handle generating the news feed.\n",
    "* **You can't take advantage of performance features, such as caching**. Because a SQLite database is a single file, and it doesn't require a special program to run, it can't have performance optimizations like caching. When running a site like Facebook that has **a ton of traffic**, it's important to be able to lookup data quickly.\n",
    "* **SQLite doesn't have any built-in security**. With a production website, it's common to want some people to be able to modify tables in a database (write), and others to only be able to make `SELECT` queries to tables in the database (read). This is because giving someone write access to the database can be a security risk, in that they can update or overwrite data. SQLite doesn't allow for restricting access to a database in this way. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, SQLite is good in cases where having a small and simple database engine is important. **SQLite is used extensively in embedded applications, such as Android and iOS applications**. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### In cases where there will be multiple users or performance is important, [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) is the most commonly used database engine. \n",
    "PostgreSQL is open source, and is free to download and use. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll look at the basics of PostgreSQL, then dive into creating a database, querying data, and some advanced features."

    "[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), also known as Postgres, is an extremely powerful database engine. \n",
    "### At a high level, [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) consists of two pieces, a server and clients. \n",
    "* The server is a program that manages databases and handles queries. \n",
    "* Clients communicate back and forth to the server. \n",
    "* Only the server ever directly accesses the databases -- the clients can only make requests to the server. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you've gone through the [APIs and Web Scraping course](https://www.dataquest.io/section/apis-and-scraping),\n",
    "\n",
    "### the communication process is very similar to making requests to a remote API. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages of this model is that multiple clients can communicate with the server at the same time. This allows multiple processes to write to a database at the same time. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible to run a [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) server either remotely or locally. If it's remote, you connect to it via the internet. If it's local, you connect to it on your own machine. In both cases, you'll be connecting to PostgreSQL via a system port. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think of ports is to think of receiving mail at an apartment building. Let's say 5 people live in an apartment building, but they only have a single address. All incoming mail will come to the address, then have to be sorted out and given to each person:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All incoming mail is **merged into a single pile**, because the whole apartment building only has one address. Each apartment occupant then has to sort through the pile to find their mail. Not only is this inefficient, it also results in some apartments getting mail that isn't theirs by accident. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make life easier for everyone by giving each apartment its own address:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, nobody has to sort mail, and it's unlikely that someone will accidentally get a message that isn't theirs. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Every computer runs dozens to hundreds of programs. Many of these programs can accept incoming connections from the internet. For instance, web servers, such as the servers that run Dataquest, run on ordinary computers and accept connections from people all over the world. Once the connections are created, data is sent along the connections.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If every program received data in the same stream, you'd have a similar situation to all of the apartments only having one address. Each program would be responsible for figuring out which messages were for it, and many messages would be sent to the wrong program. It would be impossible to know which program you were communicating with when you connected to the computer. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### One way to avoid this is for each program to have its own address. \n",
    "A system port is similar to an apartment number in that a port on a computer can only be used by one server at a time. **For example, web servers run on port `80`**. Any incoming messages on this computer port are automatically sent to the program.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### By default, PostgreSQL uses port 5432 to communicate with the outside world. \n",
    "If you start a PostgreSQL server, it will listen for incoming connections on port `5432`. Clients will be able to connect to the server using this port. If you start a client, you'll have to specify which server to connect to, along with the port to connect to."
