    "Graph-based ranking algorithms are essentially a way of deciding the importance of a vertex within a graph, based on global information recursively drawn from the entire graph. The basic idea im- plemented by a graph-based ranking model is that of “voting” or “recommendation”. When one ver- tex links to another one, it is basically casting a vote for that other vertex. The higher the number of votes that are cast for a vertex, the higher the importance of the vertex. Moreover, the importance of the vertex casting the vote determines how important the vote itself is, and this information is also taken into ac- count by the ranking model. Hence, the score asso- ciated with a vertex is determined based on the votes that are cast for it, and the score of the vertices cast- ing these votes.\n",
