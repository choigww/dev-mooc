    "\n",
    "However, that case isn't very interesting, and it doesn't tell us very much about what trade-offs we're really making by choosing that specific algorithm.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite scenario occurs when the element is very far down on the list, or doesn't exist at all. This is the case we care about, because accounting for the worst case scenario will ensure that the algorithm we choose or build is more robust.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case scenario for a list of size n, the algorithm has to check n elements. We refer to this time complexity as **linear time** because the runtime grows at a constant rate with respect to the size of the input.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms that take constant multiples of n steps (where n is the input size) are still linear time. For instance, an algorithm that takes 5n steps, or even 0.5n steps, is linear time. If we have an algorithm that prints the first half of a list (and we know the length of the list ahead of time), the algorithm will take 0.5n time. Even though it takes less than n time, we still consider it linear.<br>\n",

    "It's also worth noting that we only care about performance at a large scale. At a small scale, most algorithms will run pretty quickly, and it's only when n becomes large that we worry about time complexity.<br>\n",
