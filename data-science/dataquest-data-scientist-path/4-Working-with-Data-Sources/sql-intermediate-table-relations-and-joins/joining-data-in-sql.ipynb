If we want to be able to work with that data, we'll have to combine multiple tables within a query. The way we do this in SQL is using **joins**. As in the SQL Fundamentals course, we'll continue to use [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) throughout this course.<br>\n",

    "SELECT AVG(population) AS AVERAGE_POPULATION\n",

A right join, as the name indicates, is exactly the opposite of a left join. Where the left join includes all rows in the table before the `JOIN` clause, the right join includes all rows in the new table in the `JOIN` clause. We can see a right join in the venn diagram below:\n",

    "FROM cities c\n",
    "RIGHT JOIN facts f ON f.id = c.facts_id\n",
    "LIMIT 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "The main reason a right join would be used is in a complex query where you are joining more than two tables. In these cases, using a right join is preferable because it can avoid restructuring your whole query to join one table. Outside of this, right joins are used reasonably rarely, so for simple joins it's better to use a left join than a right as it will be easier for your query to be read and understood by others.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The other join type not supported by SQLite is a **full outer join**. A full outer join will include all rows from the tables on both sides of the join. We can see a right join in the venn diagram below:\n",

    "\n",
    "Like right joins, full outer joins are reasonably uncommon, and similar results can be achieved using a union clause (which we will teach in the next mission). The standard SQL syntax for an full outer join is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT f.name country, c.name city\n",
    "FROM cities c\n",
    "FULL OUTER JOIN facts f ON f.id = c.facts_id\n",
    "LIMIT 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "When joining `cities` and `facts` with a full outer join, the result will be be the same as our left and right joins above, because there are no values in `cities.facts_id` that don't exist in `facts.id`.<br>\n",

    "Reading subqueries can be overwhelming at first, so we'll break down what happens in this example in several steps. The important thing to remember is that the result of any subqueries are always calculated first, so we read from the inside out.\n",
    "* The subquery, in the red box, is calculated first. This simple query selects all columns from `cities`, filtering rows that are marked as `capital` cities by having a value for capital of 1.\n",
    "* The `INNER JOIN` joins the subquery result, aliased as `c`, to the `facts` table based on the `ON` clause.\n",
    "* Two columns are selected from the results of the join:\n",
    "  * `f.name`, aliased as `country`.\n",
    "  * `c.name`, aliased as `capital_city`.\n",
    "* The results are limited to the first 10 rows.\n",
