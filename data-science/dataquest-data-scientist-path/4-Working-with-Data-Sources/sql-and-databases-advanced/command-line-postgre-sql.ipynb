    "In the last mission, we worked with PostgreSQL, or Postgres, databases and tables. In this mission, we'll learn how to work with the PostgreSQL command line tool, called [psql](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/app-psql.html). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "[psql]((http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/app-psql.html)) is similar to the [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html) command line tool in that it allows you to connect to and manage databases. psql connects to a running PostgreSQL server process, then enables you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run queries.\n",
    "* Manage users and permissions.\n",
    "* Manage databases.\n",
    "* See PostgreSQL system information.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, psql will connect to a PostgreSQL server running on the current computer, using port `5432`. \n",
    "* If you don't specify a user and database to connect to, it will use the defaults. \n",
    "* By default, the name of the currently logged in system user will be used as both the PostgreSQL user name and database name.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're logged in to a computer as the system user `dq`, then type `psql`, you will connect to the `dq` database as a PostgreSQL user called dq. We'll learn later on how to connect to different databases using different PostgreSQL users. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "After you're finished working with [psql](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/app-psql.html), you can exit using the `\\q` command."
