hamlet@1022
hamlet@1023	SCENE I	Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
hamlet@1071
hamlet@1072
hamlet@1073		[FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO]
hamlet@1121
hamlet@1122	BERNARDO	Who's there?
hamlet@1144
hamlet@1145	FRANCISCO	Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
hamlet@1199
hamlet@1200	BERNARDO	Long live the king!
hamlet@1229
hamlet@1230	FRANCISCO	Bernardo?
hamlet@1250
hamlet@1251	BERNARDO	He.
hamlet@1264
hamlet@1265	FRANCISCO	You come most carefully upon your hour.
hamlet@1315
hamlet@1316	BERNARDO	'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
hamlet@1377
hamlet@1378	FRANCISCO	For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
hamlet@1435		And I am sick at heart.
hamlet@1460
hamlet@1461	BERNARDO	Have you had quiet guard?
hamlet@1496
hamlet@1497	FRANCISCO	Not a mouse stirring.
hamlet@1529
hamlet@1530	BERNARDO	Well, good night.
hamlet@1557		If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
hamlet@1596		The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
hamlet@1642
hamlet@1643	FRANCISCO	I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
hamlet@1698
hamlet@1699		[Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS]
hamlet@1730
hamlet@1731	HORATIO	Friends to this ground.
hamlet@1763
hamlet@1764	MARCELLUS	And liegemen to the Dane.
hamlet@1800
hamlet@1801	FRANCISCO	Give you good night.
hamlet@1832
hamlet@1833	MARCELLUS	O, farewell, honest soldier:
hamlet@1872		Who hath relieved you?
hamlet@1896
hamlet@1897	FRANCISCO	Bernardo has my place.
hamlet@1930		Give you good night.
hamlet@1952
hamlet@1953		[Exit]
hamlet@1961
hamlet@1962	MARCELLUS	Holla! Bernardo!
hamlet@1989
hamlet@1990	BERNARDO	Say,
hamlet@2004		What, is Horatio there?
hamlet@2029
hamlet@2030	HORATIO	A piece of him.
hamlet@2054
hamlet@2055	BERNARDO	Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
hamlet@2107
hamlet@2108	MARCELLUS	What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
hamlet@2164
hamlet@2165	BERNARDO	I have seen nothing.
hamlet@2195
hamlet@2196	MARCELLUS	Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
hamlet@2241		And will not let belief take hold of him
hamlet@2283		Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
hamlet@2331		Therefore I have entreated him along
hamlet@2369		With us to watch the minutes of this night;
hamlet@2414		That if again this apparition come,
hamlet@2451		He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
hamlet@2493
hamlet@2494	HORATIO	Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
hamlet@2533
hamlet@2534	BERNARDO	Sit down awhile;
hamlet@2560		And let us once again assail your ears,
hamlet@2601		That are so fortified against our story
hamlet@2642		What we have two nights seen.
hamlet@2673
hamlet@2674	HORATIO	Well, sit we down,
hamlet@2701		And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
hamlet@2742
hamlet@2743	BERNARDO	Last night of all,
hamlet@2771		When yond same star that's westward from the pole
hamlet@2822		Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
hamlet@2873		Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
hamlet@2916		The bell then beating one,--
hamlet@2946
hamlet@2947		[Enter Ghost]
hamlet@2962
hamlet@2963	MARCELLUS	Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
hamlet@3024
hamlet@3025	BERNARDO	In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
hamlet@3081
hamlet@3082	MARCELLUS	Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
hamlet@3134
hamlet@3135	BERNARDO	Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.
hamlet@3191
hamlet@3192	HORATIO	Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
hamlet@3247
hamlet@3248	BERNARDO	It would be spoke to.
hamlet@3279
hamlet@3280	MARCELLUS	Question it, Horatio.
hamlet@3312
hamlet@3313	HORATIO	What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
hamlet@3369		Together with that fair and warlike form
hamlet@3411		In which the majesty of buried Denmark
hamlet@3451		Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
hamlet@3505
hamlet@3506	MARCELLUS	It is offended.
hamlet@3532
hamlet@3533	BERNARDO	                  See, it stalks away!
hamlet@3581
hamlet@3582	HORATIO	Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
hamlet@3632
hamlet@3633		[Exit Ghost]
hamlet@3647
hamlet@3648	MARCELLUS	'Tis gone, and will not answer.
hamlet@3690
hamlet@3691	BERNARDO	How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
hamlet@3745		Is not this something more than fantasy?
hamlet@3787		What think you on't?
hamlet@3809
hamlet@3810	HORATIO	Before my God, I might not this believe
hamlet@3858		Without the sensible and true avouch
hamlet@3896		Of mine own eyes.
hamlet@3915
hamlet@3916	MARCELLUS	                  Is it not like the king?
hamlet@3969
hamlet@3970	HORATIO	As thou art to thyself:
hamlet@4002		Such was the very armour he had on
hamlet@4038		When he the ambitious Norway combated;
hamlet@4078		So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
hamlet@4124		He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
hamlet@4166		'Tis strange.
hamlet@4181
hamlet@4182	MARCELLUS	Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
hamlet@4239		With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
hamlet@4286
hamlet@4287	HORATIO	In what particular thought to work I know not;
hamlet@4342		But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
hamlet@4385		This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
hamlet@4433
hamlet@4434	MARCELLUS	Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
hamlet@4492		Why this same strict and most observant watch
hamlet@4539		So nightly toils the subject of the land,
hamlet@4582		And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
hamlet@4625		And foreign mart for implements of war;
hamlet@4666		Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
hamlet@4716		Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
hamlet@4759		What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
hamlet@4805		Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
hamlet@4855		Who is't that can inform me?
hamlet@4885
hamlet@4886	HORATIO	That can I;
hamlet@4906		At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
hamlet@4953		Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
hamlet@4995		Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
hamlet@5039		Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
hamlet@5084		Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
hamlet@5136		For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
hamlet@5188		Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
hamlet@5240		Well ratified by law and heraldry,
hamlet@5276		Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
hamlet@5325		Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
hamlet@5370		Against the which, a moiety competent
hamlet@5409		Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
hamlet@5452		To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
hamlet@5487		Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
hamlet@5538		And carriage of the article design'd,
hamlet@5577		His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
hamlet@5626		Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
hamlet@5662		Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
hamlet@5707		Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
hamlet@5748		For food and diet, to some enterprise
hamlet@5787		That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
hamlet@5834		As it doth well appear unto our state--
hamlet@5875		But to recover of us, by strong hand
hamlet@5913		And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
hamlet@5959		So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
hamlet@6004		Is the main motive of our preparations,
hamlet@6045		The source of this our watch and the chief head
hamlet@6094		Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
hamlet@6138
hamlet@6139	BERNARDO	I think it be no other but e'en so:
hamlet@6184		Well may it sort that this portentous figure
hamlet@6230		Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
hamlet@6279		That was and is the question of these wars.
hamlet@6324
hamlet@6325	HORATIO	A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
hamlet@6373		In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
hamlet@6416		A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
hamlet@6457		The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
hamlet@6507		Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
hamlet@6552		As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
hamlet@6601		Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
hamlet@6643		Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
hamlet@6689		Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
hamlet@6732		And even the like precurse of fierce events,
hamlet@6778		As harbingers preceding still the fates
hamlet@6819		And prologue to the omen coming on,
hamlet@6856		Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
hamlet@6901		Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
hamlet@6940		But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
hamlet@6985
hamlet@6986		[Re-enter Ghost]
hamlet@7004
hamlet@7005		I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
hamlet@7057		If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
hamlet@7099		Speak to me:
hamlet@7113		If there be any good thing to be done,
hamlet@7153		That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
hamlet@7196		Speak to me:
hamlet@7210
hamlet@7211		[Cock crows]
hamlet@7225
hamlet@7226		If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
hamlet@7268		Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
hamlet@7318		Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
hamlet@7357		Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
hamlet@7398		For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
hamlet@7451		Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
hamlet@7502
hamlet@7503	MARCELLUS	Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
hamlet@7552
hamlet@7553	HORATIO	Do, if it will not stand.
hamlet@7587
hamlet@7588	BERNARDO	'Tis here!
hamlet@7608
hamlet@7609	HORATIO	'Tis here!
hamlet@7628
hamlet@7629	MARCELLUS	'Tis gone!
hamlet@7650
hamlet@7651		[Exit Ghost]
hamlet@7665
hamlet@7666		We do it wrong, being so majestical,
hamlet@7704		To offer it the show of violence;
hamlet@7739		For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
hamlet@7777		And our vain blows malicious mockery.
hamlet@7816
hamlet@7817	BERNARDO	It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
hamlet@7869
hamlet@7870	HORATIO	And then it started like a guilty thing
hamlet@7918		Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
hamlet@7957		The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
hamlet@8001		Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
hamlet@8049		Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
hamlet@8093		Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
hamlet@8135		The extravagant and erring spirit hies
hamlet@8175		To his confine: and of the truth herein
hamlet@8216		This present object made probation.
hamlet@8253
hamlet@8254	MARCELLUS	It faded on the crowing of the cock.
hamlet@8301		Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
hamlet@8347		Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
hamlet@8391		The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
hamlet@8436		And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
hamlet@8486		The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
hamlet@8537		No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
hamlet@8585		So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
hamlet@8627
hamlet@8628	HORATIO	So have I heard and do in part believe it.
hamlet@8679		But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
hamlet@8724		Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
hamlet@8771		Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
hamlet@8813		Let us impart what we have seen to-night
hamlet@8855		Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
hamlet@8894		This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
hamlet@8939		Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
hamlet@8986		As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
hamlet@9030
hamlet@9031	MARCELLUS	Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
hamlet@9085		Where we shall find him most conveniently.

hamlet@9154	ACT I
hamlet@9160
hamlet@9161
hamlet@9162
hamlet@9163	SCENE II	A room of state in the castle.
hamlet@9203
hamlet@9204
hamlet@9205		[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,
hamlet@9252		POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords,
hamlet@9301		and Attendants]
hamlet@9318
hamlet@9319	KING CLAUDIUS	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
hamlet@9379		The memory be green, and that it us befitted
hamlet@9425		To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
hamlet@9476		To be contracted in one brow of woe,
hamlet@9514		Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
hamlet@9561		That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
hamlet@9603		Together with remembrance of ourselves.
hamlet@9644		Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
hamlet@9691		The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
hamlet@9738		Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
hamlet@9781		With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
hamlet@9821		With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
hamlet@9872		In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
hamlet@9917		Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
hamlet@9959		Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
hamlet@10004		With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
hamlet@10050		Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
hamlet@10097		Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
hamlet@10136		Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
hamlet@10182		Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
hamlet@10226		Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
hamlet@10271		He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
hamlet@10318		Importing the surrender of those lands
hamlet@10358		Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
hamlet@10402		To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
hamlet@10449		Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
hamlet@10496		Thus much the business is: we have here writ
hamlet@10542		To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
hamlet@10583		Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
hamlet@10626		Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
hamlet@10670		His further gait herein; in that the levies,
hamlet@10716		The lists and full proportions, are all made
hamlet@10762		Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
hamlet@10804		You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
hamlet@10846		For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
hamlet@10891		Giving to you no further personal power
hamlet@10932		To business with the king, more than the scope
hamlet@10980		Of these delated articles allow.
hamlet@11014		Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
hamlet@11063
hamlet@11064
hamlet@11065	CORNELIUS	|
hamlet@11077		|  In that and all things will we show our duty.
hamlet@11127	VOLTIMAND	|
hamlet@11139
hamlet@11140
hamlet@11141	KING CLAUDIUS	We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
hamlet@11195
hamlet@11196		[Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]
hamlet@11230
hamlet@11231		And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
hamlet@11276		You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
hamlet@11323		You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
hamlet@11364		And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
hamlet@11419		That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
hamlet@11464		The head is not more native to the heart,
hamlet@11507		The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
hamlet@11549		Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
hamlet@11595		What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
hamlet@11629
hamlet@11630	LAERTES	My dread lord,
hamlet@11653		Your leave and favour to return to France;
hamlet@11697		From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
hamlet@11746		To show my duty in your coronation,
hamlet@11783		Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
hamlet@11825		My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
hamlet@11874		And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
hamlet@11923
hamlet@11924	KING CLAUDIUS	Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
hamlet@11988
hamlet@11989	LORD POLONIUS	He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
hamlet@12049		By laboursome petition, and at last
hamlet@12086		Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
hamlet@12127		I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
hamlet@12168
hamlet@12169	KING CLAUDIUS	Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
hamlet@12227		And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
hamlet@12270		But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
hamlet@12312
hamlet@12313	HAMLET	[Aside]  A little more than kin, and less than kind.
hamlet@12373
hamlet@12374	KING CLAUDIUS	How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
hamlet@12433
hamlet@12434	HAMLET	Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
hamlet@12484
hamlet@12485	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
hamlet@12542		And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
hamlet@12592		Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
hamlet@12630		Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
hamlet@12670		Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
hamlet@12722		Passing through nature to eternity.
hamlet@12759
hamlet@12760	HAMLET	Ay, madam, it is common.
hamlet@12792
hamlet@12793	QUEEN GERTRUDE	If it be,
hamlet@12818		Why seems it so particular with thee?
hamlet@12857
hamlet@12858	HAMLET	Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
hamlet@12910		'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
hamlet@12954		Nor customary suits of solemn black,
hamlet@12992		Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
hamlet@13033		No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
hamlet@13073		Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
hamlet@13114		Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
hamlet@13164		That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
hamlet@13210		For they are actions that a man might play:
hamlet@13255		But I have that within which passeth show;
hamlet@13299		These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
hamlet@13346
hamlet@13347	KING CLAUDIUS	'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
hamlet@13412		To give these mourning duties to your father:
hamlet@13459		But, you must know, your father lost a father;
hamlet@13507		That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
hamlet@13559		In filial obligation for some term
hamlet@13595		To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
hamlet@13637		In obstinate condolement is a course
hamlet@13675		Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
hamlet@13721		It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
hamlet@13764		A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
hamlet@13804		An understanding simple and unschool'd:
hamlet@13845		For what we know must be and is as common
hamlet@13888		As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
hamlet@13928		Why should we in our peevish opposition
hamlet@13969		Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
hamlet@14017		A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
hamlet@14063		To reason most absurd: whose common theme
hamlet@14106		Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
hamlet@14154		From the first corse till he that died to-day,
hamlet@14202		'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
hamlet@14250		This unprevailing woe, and think of us
hamlet@14290		As of a father: for let the world take note,
hamlet@14336		You are the most immediate to our throne;
hamlet@14379		And with no less nobility of love
hamlet@14414		Than that which dearest father bears his son,
hamlet@14461		Do I impart toward you. For your intent
hamlet@14502		In going back to school in Wittenberg,
hamlet@14542		It is most retrograde to our desire:
hamlet@14580		And we beseech you, bend you to remain
hamlet@14620		Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,

hamlet@14868
hamlet@14869	KING CLAUDIUS	Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
hamlet@14920		Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
hamlet@14960		This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
hamlet@15003		Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
hamlet@15048		No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
hamlet@15094		But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
hamlet@15142		And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,

hamlet@15261	HAMLET	O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
hamlet@15312		Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
hamlet@15349		Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
hamlet@15388		His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
hamlet@15435		How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
hamlet@15477		Seem to me all the uses of this world!
hamlet@15517		Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
hamlet@15561		That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
hamlet@15614		Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
hamlet@15663		But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
hamlet@15712		So excellent a king; that was, to this,
hamlet@15753		Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
hamlet@15798		That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
hamlet@15844		Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
hamlet@15891		Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
hamlet@15937		As if increase of appetite had grown
hamlet@15975		By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
hamlet@16021		Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
hamlet@16075		A little month, or ere those shoes were old
hamlet@16120		With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
hamlet@16168		Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
hamlet@16213		O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
hamlet@16263		Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
hamlet@16314		My father's brother, but no more like my father
hamlet@16363		Than I to Hercules: within a month:
hamlet@16400		Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
hamlet@16444		Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
hamlet@16487		She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
hamlet@16531		With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!

hamlet@16980	MARCELLUS	My good lord--
hamlet@17005

hamlet@17056		But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
hamlet@17103
hamlet@17104	HORATIO	A truant disposition, good my lord.
hamlet@17148

hamlet@17192		Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
hamlet@17234		To make it truster of your own report

hamlet@17604
hamlet@17605	HAMLET	Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
hamlet@17661		Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
hamlet@17708		Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven

hamlet@18039

hamlet@18258		Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
hamlet@18296		This marvel to you.
hamlet@18317
hamlet@18318	HAMLET	For God's love, let me hear.
hamlet@18354
hamlet@18355	HORATIO	Two nights together had these gentlemen,
hamlet@18404		Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
hamlet@18445		In the dead vast and middle of the night,
hamlet@18488		Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
hamlet@18539		Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
hamlet@18574		Appears before them, and with solemn march
hamlet@18618		Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
hamlet@18667		By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
hamlet@18712		Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
hamlet@18767		Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
hamlet@18806		Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
hamlet@18851		In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
hamlet@18889		And I with them the third night kept the watch;
hamlet@18938		Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
hamlet@18983		Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
hamlet@19033		The apparition comes: I knew your father;
hamlet@19076		These hands are not more like.
hamlet@19108
hamlet@19109	HAMLET	But where was this?
hamlet@19136
hamlet@19137	MARCELLUS	My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
hamlet@19192
hamlet@19193	HAMLET	Did you not speak to it?
hamlet@19225
hamlet@19226	HORATIO	My lord, I did;
hamlet@19250		But answer made it none: yet once methought
hamlet@19295		It lifted up its head and did address
hamlet@19334		Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
hamlet@19377		But even then the morning cock crew loud,
hamlet@19420		And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
hamlet@19463		And vanish'd from our sight.
hamlet@19493
hamlet@19494	HAMLET	'Tis very strange.
hamlet@19520
hamlet@19521	HORATIO	As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
hamlet@19572		And we did think it writ down in our duty
hamlet@19615		To let you know of it.
hamlet@19639
hamlet@19640	HAMLET	Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
hamlet@19691		Hold you the watch to-night?

hamlet@19965
hamlet@19966	HORATIO	O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
hamlet@20014
hamlet@20015	HAMLET	What, look'd he frowningly?
hamlet@20050
hamlet@20051	HORATIO	A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
hamlet@20103
hamlet@20104	HAMLET	Pale or red?
hamlet@20124
hamlet@20125	HORATIO	Nay, very pale.
hamlet@20149

hamlet@20322
hamlet@20323	HAMLET	Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?

hamlet@20502	HAMLET	                  His beard was grizzled--no?

hamlet@20622

hamlet@20730	HAMLET	If it assume my noble father's person,

hamlet@20826		And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
hamlet@20869		If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
hamlet@20913		Let it be tenable in your silence still;
hamlet@20955		And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
hamlet@20996		Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
hamlet@21038		I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
hamlet@21085		Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
hamlet@21131		I'll visit you.
hamlet@21148

hamlet@21503
hamlet@21504
hamlet@21505	SCENE III	A room in Polonius' house.
hamlet@21542
hamlet@21543
hamlet@21544		[Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA]
hamlet@21573
hamlet@21574	LAERTES	My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
hamlet@21621		And, sister, as the winds give benefit
hamlet@21661		And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
hamlet@21701		But let me hear from you.
hamlet@21728
hamlet@21729	OPHELIA	Do you doubt that?
hamlet@21756
hamlet@21757	LAERTES	For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
hamlet@21808		Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
hamlet@21847		A violet in the youth of primy nature,
hamlet@21887		Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
hamlet@21932		The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
hamlet@21982
hamlet@21983	OPHELIA	       No more but so?
hamlet@22014
hamlet@22015	LAERTES	Think it no more;
hamlet@22041		For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
hamlet@22084		In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
hamlet@22131		The inward service of the mind and soul
hamlet@22172		Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
hamlet@22218		And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
hamlet@22260		The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
hamlet@22304		His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
hamlet@22353		For he himself is subject to his birth:
hamlet@22394		He may not, as unvalued persons do,
hamlet@22431		Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
hamlet@22477		The safety and health of this whole state;
hamlet@22521		And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
hamlet@22569		Unto the voice and yielding of that body
hamlet@22611		Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
hamlet@22666		It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
hamlet@22708		As he in his particular act and place
hamlet@22747		May give his saying deed; which is no further
hamlet@22794		Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
hamlet@22839		Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
hamlet@22886		If with too credent ear you list his songs,
hamlet@22931		Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
hamlet@22981		To his unmaster'd importunity.
hamlet@23013		Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
hamlet@23057		And keep you in the rear of your affection,
hamlet@23102		Out of the shot and danger of desire.
hamlet@23141		The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
hamlet@23180		If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
hamlet@23219		Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
hamlet@23266		The canker galls the infants of the spring,
hamlet@23311		Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
hamlet@23355		And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
hamlet@23396		Contagious blastments are most imminent.
hamlet@23438		Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
hamlet@23479		Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
hamlet@23527
hamlet@23528	OPHELIA	I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
hamlet@23581		As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
hamlet@23629		Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
hamlet@23669		Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
hamlet@23714		Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
hamlet@23761		Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
hamlet@23809		And recks not his own rede.
hamlet@23838
hamlet@23839	LAERTES	O, fear me not.
hamlet@23863		I stay too long: but here my father comes.
hamlet@23907

hamlet@24064		The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
hamlet@24109		And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
hamlet@24164		And these few precepts in thy memory
hamlet@24202		See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
hamlet@24252		Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
hamlet@24293		Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
hamlet@24336		Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
hamlet@24388		Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
hamlet@24435		But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
hamlet@24480		Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
hamlet@24528		Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
hamlet@24569		Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
hamlet@24614		Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
hamlet@24658		Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
hamlet@24710		Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
hamlet@24750		But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
hamlet@24796		For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
hamlet@24836		And they in France of the best rank and station
hamlet@24885		Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
hamlet@24935		Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
hamlet@24972		For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
hamlet@25016		And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
hamlet@25060		This above all: to thine ownself be true,
hamlet@25103		And it must follow, as the night the day,
hamlet@25146		Thou canst not then be false to any man.
hamlet@25188		Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!

hamlet@25578
hamlet@25579	OPHELIA	So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
hamlet@25638
hamlet@25639	LORD POLONIUS	Marry, well bethought:
hamlet@25676		'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
hamlet@25716		Given private time to you; and you yourself
hamlet@25761		Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
hamlet@25814		If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
hamlet@25850		And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
hamlet@25896		You do not understand yourself so clearly
hamlet@25939		As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
hamlet@25983		What is between you? give me up the truth.
hamlet@26027
hamlet@26028	OPHELIA	He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
hamlet@26080		Of his affection to me.
hamlet@26105
hamlet@26106	LORD POLONIUS	Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
hamlet@26166		Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
hamlet@26207		Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
hamlet@26254
hamlet@26255	OPHELIA	I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
hamlet@26308
hamlet@26309	LORD POLONIUS	Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
hamlet@26369		That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
hamlet@26418		Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
hamlet@26472		Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
hamlet@26519		Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
hamlet@26562
hamlet@26563	OPHELIA	My lord, he hath importuned me with love
hamlet@26612		In honourable fashion.
hamlet@26636
hamlet@26637	LORD POLONIUS	Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
hamlet@26694
hamlet@26695	OPHELIA	And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
hamlet@26754		With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
hamlet@26796
hamlet@26797	LORD POLONIUS	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
hamlet@26855		When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
hamlet@26900		Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
hamlet@26948		Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
hamlet@26995		Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
hamlet@27038		You must not take for fire. From this time
hamlet@27082		Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
hamlet@27128		Set your entreatments at a higher rate
hamlet@27168		Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
hamlet@27212		Believe so much in him, that he is young
hamlet@27254		And with a larger tether may he walk
hamlet@27292		Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
hamlet@27333		Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
hamlet@27381		Not of that dye which their investments show,
hamlet@27428		But mere implorators of unholy suits,
hamlet@27467		Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
hamlet@27511		The better to beguile. This is for all:
hamlet@27552		I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
hamlet@27604		Have you so slander any moment leisure,
hamlet@27645		As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
hamlet@27693		Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.

hamlet@28537		But to my mind, though I am native here
hamlet@28578		And to the manner born, it is a custom
hamlet@28618		More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
hamlet@28668		This heavy-headed revel east and west
hamlet@28707		Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
hamlet@28754		They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
hamlet@28804		Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
hamlet@28844		From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
hamlet@28896		The pith and marrow of our attribute.
hamlet@28935		So, oft it chances in particular men,
hamlet@28974		That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
hamlet@29021		As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
hamlet@29071		Since nature cannot choose his origin--
hamlet@29112		By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
hamlet@29151		Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
hamlet@29201		Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
hamlet@29246		The form of plausive manners, that these men,
hamlet@29293		Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
hamlet@29336		Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
hamlet@29381		Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
hamlet@29428		As infinite as man may undergo--
hamlet@29462		Shall in the general censure take corruption
hamlet@29508		From that particular fault: the dram of eale
hamlet@29554		Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
hamlet@29595		To his own scandal.

hamlet@29816		Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
hamlet@29854		Thou comest in such a questionable shape
hamlet@29896		That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
hamlet@29947		King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
hamlet@29988		Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
hamlet@30029		Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
hamlet@30073		Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
hamlet@30121		Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
hamlet@30159		Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
hamlet@30201		To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
hamlet@30245		That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
hamlet@30293		Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
hamlet@30336		Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
hamlet@30382		So horridly to shake our disposition
hamlet@30420		With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
hamlet@30468		Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
hamlet@30517
hamlet@30518		[Ghost beckons HAMLET]
hamlet@30542
hamlet@30543	HORATIO	It beckons you to go away with it,
hamlet@30586		As if it some impartment did desire
hamlet@30623		To you alone.
hamlet@30638
hamlet@30639	MARCELLUS	                  Look, with what courteous action
hamlet@30700		It waves you to a more removed ground:
hamlet@30740		But do not go with it.
hamlet@30764
hamlet@30765	HORATIO	No, by no means.
hamlet@30790
hamlet@30791	HAMLET	It will not speak; then I will follow it.

hamlet@30841	HORATIO	Do not, my lord.
hamlet@30866
hamlet@30867	HAMLET	                  Why, what should be the fear?
hamlet@30922		I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
hamlet@30960		And for my soul, what can it do to that,
hamlet@31002		Being a thing immortal as itself?
hamlet@31037		It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
hamlet@31079
hamlet@31080	HORATIO	What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
hamlet@31136		Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
hamlet@31176		That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
hamlet@31218		And there assume some other horrible form,
hamlet@31262		Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
hamlet@31310		And draw you into madness? think of it:
hamlet@31351		The very place puts toys of desperation,
hamlet@31393		Without more motive, into every brain
hamlet@31432		That looks so many fathoms to the sea
hamlet@31471		And hears it roar beneath.
hamlet@31499
hamlet@31500	HAMLET	It waves me still.
hamlet@31526		Go on; I'll follow thee.
hamlet@31552
hamlet@31553	MARCELLUS	You shall not go, my lord.
hamlet@31590

hamlet@31656
hamlet@31657	HAMLET	My fate cries out,
hamlet@31683		And makes each petty artery in this body
hamlet@31725		As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
hamlet@31763		Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
hamlet@31805		By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
hamlet@31856		I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.

hamlet@32649
hamlet@32650	Ghost	 So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
hamlet@32703
hamlet@32704	HAMLET	What?
hamlet@32717
hamlet@32718	Ghost	I am thy father's spirit,
hamlet@32750		Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
hamlet@32796		And for the day confined to fast in fires,
hamlet@32840		Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
hamlet@32888		Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
hamlet@32937		To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
hamlet@32978		I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
hamlet@33021		Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
hamlet@33072		Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
hamlet@33130		Thy knotted and combined locks to part
hamlet@33170		And each particular hair to stand on end,
hamlet@33213		Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
hamlet@33255		But this eternal blazon must not be
hamlet@33292		To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
hamlet@33342		If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
hamlet@33385
hamlet@33386	HAMLET	O God!
hamlet@33400
hamlet@33401	Ghost	Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
hamlet@33451
hamlet@33452	HAMLET	Murder!
hamlet@33467
hamlet@33468	Ghost	Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
hamlet@33514		But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
hamlet@33558
hamlet@33559	HAMLET	Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
hamlet@33614		As meditation or the thoughts of love,
hamlet@33654		May sweep to my revenge.
hamlet@33680
hamlet@33681	Ghost	I find thee apt;
hamlet@33704		And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
hamlet@33751		That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
hamlet@33794		Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
hamlet@33845		'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
hamlet@33891		A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
hamlet@33940		Is by a forged process of my death
hamlet@33976		Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
hamlet@34020		The serpent that did sting thy father's life
hamlet@34066		Now wears his crown.
hamlet@34088
hamlet@34089	HAMLET	O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
hamlet@34127
hamlet@34128	Ghost	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
hamlet@34178		With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
hamlet@34232		O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
hamlet@34277		So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
hamlet@34318		The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
hamlet@34363		O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
hamlet@34404		From me, whose love was of that dignity
hamlet@34445		That it went hand in hand even with the vow
hamlet@34490		I made to her in marriage, and to decline
hamlet@34533		Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
hamlet@34578		To those of mine!
hamlet@34597		But virtue, as it never will be moved,
hamlet@34637		Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
hamlet@34685		So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
hamlet@34729		Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
hamlet@34767		And prey on garbage.
hamlet@34789		But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
hamlet@34835		Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
hamlet@34881		My custom always of the afternoon,
hamlet@34917		Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
hamlet@34955		With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
hamlet@34996		And in the porches of my ears did pour
hamlet@35036		The leperous distilment; whose effect
hamlet@35075		Holds such an enmity with blood of man
hamlet@35115		That swift as quicksilver it courses through
hamlet@35161		The natural gates and alleys of the body,
hamlet@35204		And with a sudden vigour doth posset
hamlet@35242		And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
hamlet@35285		The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
hamlet@35332		And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
hamlet@35373		Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
hamlet@35422		All my smooth body.
hamlet@35443		Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
hamlet@35486		Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
hamlet@35536		Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
hamlet@35577		Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
hamlet@35614		No reckoning made, but sent to my account
hamlet@35657		With all my imperfections on my head:
hamlet@35696		O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
hamlet@35738		If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
hamlet@35781		Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
hamlet@35818		A couch for luxury and damned incest.
hamlet@35857		But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
hamlet@35897		Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
hamlet@35944		Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
hamlet@35991		And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
hamlet@36037		To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
hamlet@36086		The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
hamlet@36129		And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
hamlet@36170		Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.

hamlet@36368		But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
hamlet@36408		Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
hamlet@36456		In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
hamlet@36498		Yea, from the table of my memory
hamlet@36532		I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
hamlet@36574		All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
hamlet@36625		That youth and observation copied there;
hamlet@36667		And thy commandment all alone shall live
hamlet@36709		Within the book and volume of my brain,
hamlet@36750		Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!

hamlet@36820		O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!

hamlet@36905		That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
hamlet@36955		At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
hamlet@36999
hamlet@37000		[Writing]

hamlet@39978		How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
hamlet@40020		As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
hamlet@40063		To put an antic disposition on,
hamlet@40096		That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
hamlet@40145		With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
hamlet@40192		Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,

hamlet@41249
hamlet@41250	REYNALDO	                  My lord, I did intend it.
hamlet@41303
hamlet@41304	LORD POLONIUS	Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
hamlet@41367		Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
hamlet@41413		And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
hamlet@41465		What company, at what expense; and finding
hamlet@41509		By this encompassment and drift of question
hamlet@41554		That they do know my son, come you more nearer
hamlet@41602		Than your particular demands will touch it:
hamlet@41647		Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
hamlet@41700		As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
hamlet@41746		And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
hamlet@41794
hamlet@41795	REYNALDO	Ay, very well, my lord.
hamlet@41828

hamlet@41973		What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank

hamlet@42063		But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
hamlet@42108		As are companions noted and most known
hamlet@42148		To youth and liberty.
hamlet@42171
hamlet@42172	REYNALDO	As gaming, my lord.
hamlet@42201
hamlet@42202	LORD POLONIUS	Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
hamlet@42265		Drabbing: you may go so far.
hamlet@42295
hamlet@42296	REYNALDO	My lord, that would dishonour him.
hamlet@42340
hamlet@42341	LORD POLONIUS	'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
hamlet@42402		You must not put another scandal on him,
hamlet@42444		That he is open to incontinency;
hamlet@42478		That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
hamlet@42537		That they may seem the taints of liberty,
hamlet@42580		The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
hamlet@42621		A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
hamlet@42657		Of general assault.
hamlet@42678
hamlet@42679	REYNALDO	But, my good lord,--
hamlet@42709
hamlet@42710	LORD POLONIUS	Wherefore should you do this?
hamlet@42754
hamlet@42755	REYNALDO	Ay, my lord,
hamlet@42777		I would know that.
hamlet@42797
hamlet@42798	LORD POLONIUS	                  Marry, sir, here's my drift;
hamlet@42859		And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
hamlet@42897		You laying these slight sullies on my son,
hamlet@42941		As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
hamlet@43002		Your party in converse, him you would sound,
hamlet@43048		Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
hamlet@43092		The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
hamlet@43137		He closes with you in this consequence;
hamlet@43178		'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
hamlet@43227		According to the phrase or the addition
hamlet@43268		Of man and country.
hamlet@43289
hamlet@43290	REYNALDO	Very good, my lord.
hamlet@43319
hamlet@43320	LORD POLONIUS	And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
hamlet@43383		about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
hamlet@43430		something: where did I leave?
hamlet@43461
hamlet@43462	REYNALDO	At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
hamlet@43522		and 'gentleman.'
hamlet@43540
hamlet@43541	LORD POLONIUS	At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
hamlet@43598		He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
hamlet@43638		I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
hamlet@43677		Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
hamlet@43733		There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
hamlet@43782		There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
hamlet@43827		'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
hamlet@43868		Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
hamlet@43904		See you now;
hamlet@43918		Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
hamlet@43968		And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
hamlet@44008		With windlasses and with assays of bias,
hamlet@44050		By indirections find directions out:
hamlet@44088		So by my former lecture and advice,
hamlet@44125		Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
hamlet@44171
hamlet@44172	REYNALDO	My lord, I have.
hamlet@44198
hamlet@44199	LORD POLONIUS	                  God be wi' you; fare you well.
hamlet@44262
hamlet@44263	REYNALDO	Good my lord!
hamlet@44286
hamlet@44287	LORD POLONIUS	Observe his inclination in yourself.
hamlet@44338
hamlet@44339	REYNALDO	I shall, my lord.
hamlet@44366
hamlet@44367	LORD POLONIUS	And let him ply his music.
hamlet@44408
hamlet@44409	REYNALDO	Well, my lord.
hamlet@44433
hamlet@44434	LORD POLONIUS	Farewell!
hamlet@44458
hamlet@44459		[Exit REYNALDO]
hamlet@44476
hamlet@44477		[Enter OPHELIA]
hamlet@44494
hamlet@44495		How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
hamlet@44533
hamlet@44534	OPHELIA	O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
hamlet@44590
hamlet@44591	LORD POLONIUS	With what, i' the name of God?
hamlet@44636
hamlet@44637	OPHELIA	My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
hamlet@44684		Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
hamlet@44729		No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
hamlet@44774		Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
hamlet@44816		Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
hamlet@44867		And with a look so piteous in purport
hamlet@44906		As if he had been loosed out of hell
hamlet@44944		To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
hamlet@44987
hamlet@44988	LORD POLONIUS	Mad for thy love?
hamlet@45020
hamlet@45021	OPHELIA	                  My lord, I do not know;
hamlet@45071		But truly, I do fear it.
hamlet@45097
hamlet@45098	LORD POLONIUS	What said he?
hamlet@45126
hamlet@45127	OPHELIA	He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
hamlet@45177		Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
hamlet@45221		And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
hamlet@45267		He falls to such perusal of my face
hamlet@45304		As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
hamlet@45345		At last, a little shaking of mine arm
hamlet@45384		And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
hamlet@45430		He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
hamlet@45472		As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
hamlet@45512		And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
hamlet@45558		And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
hamlet@45604		He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
hamlet@45649		For out o' doors he went without their helps,
hamlet@45696		And, to the last, bended their light on me.
hamlet@45741
hamlet@45742	LORD POLONIUS	Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
hamlet@45799		This is the very ecstasy of love,
hamlet@45834		Whose violent property fordoes itself
hamlet@45873		And leads the will to desperate undertakings
hamlet@45919		As oft as any passion under heaven
hamlet@45955		That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
hamlet@45999		What, have you given him any hard words of late?
hamlet@46049
hamlet@46050	OPHELIA	No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
hamlet@46101		I did repel his fetters and denied
hamlet@46137		His access to me.
hamlet@46156
hamlet@46157	LORD POLONIUS	                  That hath made him mad.
hamlet@46213		I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
hamlet@46260		I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
hamlet@46311		And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
hamlet@46363		By heaven, it is as proper to our age
hamlet@46402		To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
hamlet@46444		As it is common for the younger sort
hamlet@46482		To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
hamlet@46528		This must be known; which, being kept close, might
hamlet@46580		move
hamlet@46586		More grief to hide than hate to utter love.

hamlet@46751		GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants]
hamlet@46782
hamlet@46783	KING CLAUDIUS	Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
hamlet@46841		Moreover that we much did long to see you,
hamlet@46885		The need we have to use you did provoke
hamlet@46926		Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
hamlet@46971		Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
hamlet@47012		Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
hamlet@47054		Resembles that it was. What it should be,
hamlet@47097		More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
hamlet@47151		So much from the understanding of himself,
hamlet@47195		I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
hamlet@47235		That, being of so young days brought up with him,
hamlet@47286		And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
hamlet@47336		That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
hamlet@47384		Some little time: so by your companies
hamlet@47424		To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
hamlet@47469		So much as from occasion you may glean,
hamlet@47510		Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
hamlet@47560		That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
hamlet@47599
hamlet@47600	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
hamlet@47659		And sure I am two men there are not living
hamlet@47703		To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
hamlet@47751		To show us so much gentry and good will
hamlet@47792		As to expend your time with us awhile,
hamlet@47832		For the supply and profit of our hope,
hamlet@47872		Your visitation shall receive such thanks
hamlet@47915		As fits a king's remembrance.
hamlet@47946
hamlet@47947	ROSENCRANTZ	Both your majesties
hamlet@47979		Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
hamlet@48026		Put your dread pleasures more into command
hamlet@48070		Than to entreaty.
hamlet@48089
hamlet@48090	GUILDENSTERN	                  But we both obey,
hamlet@48139		And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
hamlet@48185		To lay our service freely at your feet,
hamlet@48226		To be commanded.
hamlet@48244
hamlet@48245	KING CLAUDIUS	Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
hamlet@48304
hamlet@48305	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
hamlet@48365		And I beseech you instantly to visit
hamlet@48403		My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
hamlet@48446		And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
hamlet@48490
hamlet@48491	GUILDENSTERN	Heavens make our presence and our practises
hamlet@48548		Pleasant and helpful to him!

hamlet@48664		[Enter POLONIUS]
hamlet@48682
hamlet@48683	LORD POLONIUS	The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
hamlet@48740		Are joyfully return'd.
hamlet@48764
hamlet@48765	KING CLAUDIUS	Thou still hast been the father of good news.
hamlet@48825
hamlet@48826	LORD POLONIUS	Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
hamlet@48881		I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
hamlet@48917		Both to my God and to my gracious king:
hamlet@48958		And I do think, or else this brain of mine
hamlet@49002		Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
hamlet@49041		As it hath used to do, that I have found
hamlet@49083		The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
hamlet@49119
hamlet@49120	KING CLAUDIUS	O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
hamlet@49176
hamlet@49177	LORD POLONIUS	Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
hamlet@49233		My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
hamlet@49282
hamlet@49283	KING CLAUDIUS	Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
hamlet@49342
hamlet@49343		[Exit POLONIUS]
hamlet@49360
hamlet@49361		He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
hamlet@49407		The head and source of all your son's distemper.
hamlet@49457
hamlet@49458	QUEEN GERTRUDE	I doubt it is no other but the main;
hamlet@49510		His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
hamlet@49559
hamlet@49560	KING CLAUDIUS	Well, we shall sift him.
hamlet@49599
hamlet@49600		[Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]
hamlet@49651
hamlet@49652			   Welcome, my good friends!
hamlet@49683		Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
hamlet@49730
hamlet@49731	VOLTIMAND	Most fair return of greetings and desires.
hamlet@49784		Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
hamlet@49825		His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
hamlet@49869		To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
hamlet@49910		But, better look'd into, he truly found
hamlet@49951		It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
hamlet@49999		That so his sickness, age and impotence
hamlet@50040		Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
hamlet@50086		On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
hamlet@50129		Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
hamlet@50171		Makes vow before his uncle never more
hamlet@50210		To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
hamlet@50259		Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
hamlet@50299		Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
hamlet@50347		And his commission to employ those soldiers,
hamlet@50393		So levied as before, against the Polack:
hamlet@50435		With an entreaty, herein further shown,
hamlet@50476
hamlet@50477		[Giving a paper]
hamlet@50495
hamlet@50496		That it might please you to give quiet pass
hamlet@50541		Through your dominions for this enterprise,
hamlet@50586		On such regards of safety and allowance
hamlet@50627		As therein are set down.
hamlet@50653
hamlet@50654	KING CLAUDIUS	It likes us well;
hamlet@50686		And at our more consider'd time well read,
hamlet@50730		Answer, and think upon this business.
hamlet@50769		Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
hamlet@50819		Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
hamlet@50868		Most welcome home!
hamlet@50888
hamlet@50889		[Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]
hamlet@50923
hamlet@50924	LORD POLONIUS	                  This business is well ended.
hamlet@50985		My liege, and madam, to expostulate
hamlet@51022		What majesty should be, what duty is,
hamlet@51061		Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
hamlet@51109		Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
hamlet@51157		Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
hamlet@51203		And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
hamlet@51254		I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
hamlet@51295		Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
hamlet@51340		What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
hamlet@51383		But let that go.
hamlet@51401
hamlet@51402	QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  More matter, with less art.
hamlet@51463
hamlet@51464	LORD POLONIUS	Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
hamlet@51514		That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
hamlet@51563		And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
hamlet@51607		But farewell it, for I will use no art.
hamlet@51648		Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
hamlet@51693		That we find out the cause of this effect,
hamlet@51737		Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
hamlet@51779		For this effect defective comes by cause:
hamlet@51822		Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
hamlet@51873		I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
hamlet@51918		Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
hamlet@51957		Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
hamlet@52003
hamlet@52004		[Reads]
hamlet@52013
hamlet@52014		'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
hamlet@52062		beautified Ophelia,'--
hamlet@52086		That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
hamlet@52140		a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
hamlet@52182
hamlet@52183		[Reads]
hamlet@52192
hamlet@52193		'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
hamlet@52237
hamlet@52238	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Came this from Hamlet to her?
hamlet@52283
hamlet@52284	LORD POLONIUS	Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
hamlet@52343
hamlet@52344		[Reads]
hamlet@52353
hamlet@52354		'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
hamlet@52387		Doubt that the sun doth move;
hamlet@52418		Doubt truth to be a liar;
hamlet@52445		But never doubt I love.
hamlet@52470		'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
hamlet@52515		I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
hamlet@52561		I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
hamlet@52612		'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
hamlet@52652		this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
hamlet@52686		This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
hamlet@52734		And more above, hath his solicitings,
hamlet@52773		As they fell out by time, by means and place,
hamlet@52820		All given to mine ear.
hamlet@52844
hamlet@52845	KING CLAUDIUS	But how hath she
hamlet@52876		Received his love?
hamlet@52896
hamlet@52897	LORD POLONIUS	                  What do you think of me?
hamlet@52954
hamlet@52955	KING CLAUDIUS	As of a man faithful and honourable.
hamlet@53006
hamlet@53007	LORD POLONIUS	I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
hamlet@53070		When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
hamlet@53115		As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
hamlet@53157		Before my daughter told me--what might you,
hamlet@53202		Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
hamlet@53246		If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
hamlet@53287		Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
hamlet@53332		Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
hamlet@53375		What might you think? No, I went round to work,
hamlet@53424		And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
hamlet@53467		'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
hamlet@53511		This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
hamlet@53561		That she should lock herself from his resort,
hamlet@53608		Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
hamlet@53649		Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
hamlet@53696		And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
hamlet@53738		Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
hamlet@53778		Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
hamlet@53822		Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
hamlet@53871		Into the madness wherein now he raves,
hamlet@53911		And all we mourn for.
hamlet@53934
hamlet@53935	KING CLAUDIUS	Do you think 'tis this?
hamlet@53973
hamlet@53974	QUEEN GERTRUDE	It may be, very likely.
hamlet@54013
hamlet@54014	LORD POLONIUS	Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
hamlet@54078		That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
hamlet@54117		When it proved otherwise?
hamlet@54144
hamlet@54145	KING CLAUDIUS	Not that I know.
hamlet@54176
hamlet@54177	LORD POLONIUS	[Pointing to his head and shoulder]
hamlet@54227
hamlet@54228		Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
hamlet@54272		If circumstances lead me, I will find
hamlet@54311		Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
hamlet@54358		Within the centre.
hamlet@54378
hamlet@54379	KING CLAUDIUS	                  How may we try it further?
hamlet@54438
hamlet@54439	LORD POLONIUS	You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
hamlet@54502		Here in the lobby.
hamlet@54522
hamlet@54523	QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  So he does indeed.
hamlet@54575
hamlet@54576	LORD POLONIUS	At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
hamlet@54636		Be you and I behind an arras then;
hamlet@54672		Mark the encounter: if he love her not
hamlet@54712		And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
hamlet@54756		Let me be no assistant for a state,
hamlet@54793		But keep a farm and carters.
hamlet@54823
hamlet@54824	KING CLAUDIUS	We will try it.
hamlet@54854
hamlet@54855	QUEEN GERTRUDE	But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
hamlet@54924
hamlet@54925	LORD POLONIUS	Away, I do beseech you, both away:
hamlet@54974		I'll board him presently.
hamlet@55001
hamlet@55002		[Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and
hamlet@55046		Attendants]
hamlet@55059
hamlet@55060		[Enter HAMLET, reading]
hamlet@55085
hamlet@55086			    O, give me leave:
hamlet@55110		How does my good Lord Hamlet?
hamlet@55141
hamlet@55142	HAMLET	Well, God-a-mercy.
hamlet@55168
hamlet@55169	LORD POLONIUS	Do you know me, my lord?
hamlet@55208
hamlet@55209	HAMLET	Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
hamlet@55254
hamlet@55255	LORD POLONIUS	Not I, my lord.
hamlet@55285
hamlet@55286	HAMLET	Then I would you were so honest a man.
hamlet@55332
hamlet@55333	LORD POLONIUS	Honest, my lord!
hamlet@55364
hamlet@55365	HAMLET	Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
hamlet@55424		one man picked out of ten thousand.
hamlet@55461
hamlet@55462	LORD POLONIUS	That's very true, my lord.
hamlet@55503
hamlet@55504	HAMLET	For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
hamlet@55563		god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?
hamlet@55607
hamlet@55608	LORD POLONIUS	I have, my lord.
hamlet@55639
hamlet@55640	HAMLET	Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
hamlet@55692		blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
hamlet@55742		Friend, look to 't.
hamlet@55763
hamlet@55764	LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  How say you by that? Still harping on my
hamlet@55828		daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
hamlet@55878		was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
hamlet@55927		truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
hamlet@55976		love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
hamlet@56024		What do you read, my lord?
hamlet@56052
hamlet@56053	HAMLET	Words, words, words.
hamlet@56081
hamlet@56082	LORD POLONIUS	What is the matter, my lord?
hamlet@56125
hamlet@56126	HAMLET	Between who?
hamlet@56146
hamlet@56147	LORD POLONIUS	I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
hamlet@56204
hamlet@56205	HAMLET	Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
hamlet@56261		that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
hamlet@56314		wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
hamlet@56360		plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
hamlet@56414		wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
hamlet@56466		though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
hamlet@56518		I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
hamlet@56571		yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
hamlet@56625		you could go backward.
hamlet@56649
hamlet@56650	LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  Though this be madness, yet there is method
hamlet@56717		in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
hamlet@56764
hamlet@56765	HAMLET	Into my grave.
hamlet@56787
hamlet@56788	LORD POLONIUS	Indeed, that is out o' the air.
hamlet@56834
hamlet@56835		[Aside]
hamlet@56844
hamlet@56845		How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
hamlet@56898		that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
hamlet@56951		could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
hamlet@57002		leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
hamlet@57049		meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable
hamlet@57102		lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
hamlet@57150
hamlet@57151	HAMLET	You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
hamlet@57210		more willingly part withal: except my life, except
hamlet@57262		my life, except my life.
hamlet@57288
hamlet@57289	LORD POLONIUS	Fare you well, my lord.
hamlet@57327
hamlet@57328	HAMLET	These tedious old fools!
hamlet@57360
hamlet@57361		[Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
hamlet@57399
hamlet@57400	LORD POLONIUS	You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
hamlet@57459
hamlet@57460	ROSENCRANTZ	[To POLONIUS]  God save you, sir!
hamlet@57506
hamlet@57507		[Exit POLONIUS]
hamlet@57524
hamlet@57525	GUILDENSTERN	My honoured lord!
hamlet@57556
hamlet@57557	ROSENCRANTZ	My most dear lord!
hamlet@57588
hamlet@57589	HAMLET	My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
hamlet@57638		Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
hamlet@57697
hamlet@57698	ROSENCRANTZ	As the indifferent children of the earth.
hamlet@57752
hamlet@57753	GUILDENSTERN	Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
hamlet@57804		On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
hamlet@57850
hamlet@57851	HAMLET	Nor the soles of her shoe?
hamlet@57885
hamlet@57886	ROSENCRANTZ	Neither, my lord.
hamlet@57916
hamlet@57917	HAMLET	Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
hamlet@57975		her favours?
hamlet@57989
hamlet@57990	GUILDENSTERN	'Faith, her privates we.
hamlet@58028
hamlet@58029	HAMLET	In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she
hamlet@58086		is a strumpet. What's the news?
hamlet@58119
hamlet@58120	ROSENCRANTZ	None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
hamlet@58182
hamlet@58183	HAMLET	Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
hamlet@58240		Let me question more in particular: what have you,
hamlet@58292		my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
hamlet@58344		that she sends you to prison hither?
hamlet@58382
hamlet@58383	GUILDENSTERN	Prison, my lord!
hamlet@58413
hamlet@58414	HAMLET	Denmark's a prison.
hamlet@58441
hamlet@58442	ROSENCRANTZ	Then is the world one.
hamlet@58477
hamlet@58478	HAMLET	A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
hamlet@58533		wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
hamlet@58586
hamlet@58587	ROSENCRANTZ	We think not so, my lord.
hamlet@58625
hamlet@58626	HAMLET	Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
hamlet@58683		either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
hamlet@58736		it is a prison.
hamlet@58753
hamlet@58754	ROSENCRANTZ	Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
hamlet@58813		narrow for your mind.
hamlet@58836
hamlet@58837	HAMLET	O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
hamlet@58895		myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
hamlet@58948		have bad dreams.
hamlet@58966
hamlet@58967	GUILDENSTERN	Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
hamlet@59027		substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
hamlet@59088
hamlet@59089	HAMLET	A dream itself is but a shadow.
hamlet@59128
hamlet@59129	ROSENCRANTZ	Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
hamlet@59191		quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
hamlet@59234
hamlet@59235	HAMLET	Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
hamlet@59292		outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
hamlet@59344		to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
hamlet@59392
hamlet@59393
hamlet@59394	ROSENCRANTZ	|
hamlet@59408		| We'll wait upon you.
hamlet@59432	GUILDENSTERN	|
hamlet@59447
hamlet@59448
hamlet@59449	HAMLET	No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
hamlet@59506		of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
hamlet@59559		man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
hamlet@59608		beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
hamlet@59662
hamlet@59663	ROSENCRANTZ	To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
hamlet@59717
hamlet@59718	HAMLET	Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
hamlet@59775		thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
hamlet@59825		too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
hamlet@59877		your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
hamlet@59929		deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
hamlet@59975
hamlet@59976	GUILDENSTERN	What should we say, my lord?
hamlet@60018
hamlet@60019	HAMLET	Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
hamlet@60076		for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
hamlet@60130		which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
hamlet@60185		I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
hamlet@60236
hamlet@60237	ROSENCRANTZ	To what end, my lord?
hamlet@60271
hamlet@60272	HAMLET	That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
hamlet@60330		the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
hamlet@60382		our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
hamlet@60434		love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
hamlet@60487		charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
hamlet@60535		whether you were sent for, or no?
hamlet@60570
hamlet@60571	ROSENCRANTZ	[Aside to GUILDENSTERN]  What say you?
hamlet@60622
hamlet@60623	HAMLET	[Aside]  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
hamlet@60680		love me, hold not off.
hamlet@60704
hamlet@60705	GUILDENSTERN	My lord, we were sent for.
hamlet@60745
hamlet@60746	HAMLET	I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
hamlet@60799		prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
hamlet@60853		and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
hamlet@60902		wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
hamlet@60956		custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
hamlet@61008		with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
hamlet@61057		earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
hamlet@61109		excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
hamlet@61158		o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
hamlet@61211		with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
hamlet@61264		me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
hamlet@61319		What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
hamlet@61372		how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
hamlet@61421		express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
hamlet@61474		in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
hamlet@61525		world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
hamlet@61573		what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
hamlet@61626		me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
hamlet@61677		you seem to say so.
hamlet@61698
hamlet@61699	ROSENCRANTZ	My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
hamlet@61760
hamlet@61761	HAMLET	Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
hamlet@61827
hamlet@61828	ROSENCRANTZ	To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
hamlet@61891		lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
hamlet@61944		you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
hamlet@61996		coming, to offer you service.
hamlet@62027
hamlet@62028	HAMLET	He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
hamlet@62088		shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
hamlet@62138		shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
hamlet@62190		sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
hamlet@62241		in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
hamlet@62291		lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
hamlet@62342		say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
hamlet@62394		for't. What players are they?
hamlet@62425
hamlet@62426	ROSENCRANTZ	Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
hamlet@62487		tragedians of the city.
hamlet@62512
hamlet@62513	HAMLET	How chances it they travel? their residence, both
hamlet@62570		in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
hamlet@62619
hamlet@62620	ROSENCRANTZ	I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
hamlet@62683		late innovation.
hamlet@62701
hamlet@62702	HAMLET	Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
hamlet@62762		in the city? are they so followed?
hamlet@62798
hamlet@62799	ROSENCRANTZ	No, indeed, are they not.
hamlet@62837
hamlet@62838	HAMLET	How comes it? do they grow rusty?
hamlet@62879
hamlet@62880	ROSENCRANTZ	Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
hamlet@62943		there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
hamlet@62995		that cry out on the top of question, and are most
hamlet@63046		tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
hamlet@63093		fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
hamlet@63146		call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
hamlet@63198		goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
hamlet@63242
hamlet@63243	HAMLET	What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
hamlet@63302		they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
hamlet@63349		longer than they can sing? will they not say
hamlet@63395		afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
hamlet@63449		players--as it is most like, if their means are no
hamlet@63501		better--their writers do them wrong, to make them
hamlet@63552		exclaim against their own succession?
hamlet@63591
hamlet@63592	ROSENCRANTZ	'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
hamlet@63657		the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
hamlet@63702		controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
hamlet@63753		for argument, unless the poet and the player went to
hamlet@63807		cuffs in the question.
hamlet@63831
hamlet@63832	HAMLET	Is't possible?
hamlet@63854
hamlet@63855	GUILDENSTERN	O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
hamlet@63917
hamlet@63918	HAMLET	Do the boys carry it away?
hamlet@63952
hamlet@63953	ROSENCRANTZ	Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
hamlet@64019
hamlet@64020	HAMLET	It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
hamlet@64077		Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
hamlet@64131		my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an
hamlet@64179		hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
hamlet@64230		'Sblood, there is something in this more than
hamlet@64277		natural, if philosophy could find it out.
hamlet@64320
hamlet@64321		[Flourish of trumpets within]
hamlet@64352
hamlet@64353	GUILDENSTERN	There are the players.
hamlet@64389
hamlet@64390	HAMLET	Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
hamlet@64449		come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
hamlet@64500		and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
hamlet@64552		lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
hamlet@64603		must show fairly outward, should more appear like
hamlet@64654		entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
hamlet@64705		uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
hamlet@64749
hamlet@64750	GUILDENSTERN	In what, my dear lord?
hamlet@64786
hamlet@64787	HAMLET	I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
hamlet@64842		southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
hamlet@64883
hamlet@64884		[Enter POLONIUS]
hamlet@64902
hamlet@64903	LORD POLONIUS	Well be with you, gentlemen!
hamlet@64946
hamlet@64947	HAMLET	Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
hamlet@65005		hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
hamlet@65055		out of his swaddling-clouts.
hamlet@65085
hamlet@65086	ROSENCRANTZ	Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
hamlet@65150		say an old man is twice a child.
hamlet@65184
hamlet@65185	HAMLET	I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
hamlet@65244		mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
hamlet@65293		'twas so indeed.
hamlet@65311
hamlet@65312	LORD POLONIUS	My lord, I have news to tell you.
hamlet@65360
hamlet@65361	HAMLET	My lord, I have news to tell you.
hamlet@65402		When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
hamlet@65440
hamlet@65441	LORD POLONIUS	The actors are come hither, my lord.
hamlet@65492
hamlet@65493	HAMLET	Buz, buz!
hamlet@65510
hamlet@65511	LORD POLONIUS	Upon mine honour,--
hamlet@65545
hamlet@65546	HAMLET	Then came each actor on his ass,--
hamlet@65588
hamlet@65589	LORD POLONIUS	The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
hamlet@65653		comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
hamlet@65699		historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
hamlet@65752		comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
hamlet@65804		poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
hamlet@65853		Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
hamlet@65901		liberty, these are the only men.
hamlet@65935
hamlet@65936	HAMLET	O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
hamlet@66000
hamlet@66001	LORD POLONIUS	What a treasure had he, my lord?
hamlet@66048
hamlet@66049	HAMLET	Why,
hamlet@66061		'One fair daughter and no more,
hamlet@66094		The which he loved passing well.'
hamlet@66129
hamlet@66130	LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  Still on my daughter.
hamlet@66175
hamlet@66176	HAMLET	Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
hamlet@66220
hamlet@66221	LORD POLONIUS	If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
hamlet@66287		that I love passing well.
hamlet@66314
hamlet@66315	HAMLET	Nay, that follows not.
hamlet@66345
hamlet@66346	LORD POLONIUS	What follows, then, my lord?
hamlet@66389
hamlet@66390	HAMLET	Why,
hamlet@66402		'As by lot, God wot,'
hamlet@66425		and then, you know,
hamlet@66446		'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
hamlet@66489		the first row of the pious chanson will show you
hamlet@66539		more; for look, where my abridgement comes.
hamlet@66584
hamlet@66585		[Enter four or five Players]
hamlet@66615
hamlet@66616		You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
hamlet@66667		to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
hamlet@66719		friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
hamlet@66772		comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
hamlet@66824		lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
hamlet@66872		nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
hamlet@66923		altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
hamlet@66974		apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
hamlet@67027		ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
hamlet@67075		to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
hamlet@67129		we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
hamlet@67182		of your quality; come, a passionate speech.
hamlet@67227
hamlet@67228	First Player	What speech, my lord?
hamlet@67263
hamlet@67264	HAMLET	I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
hamlet@67319		never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
hamlet@67372		play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
hamlet@67422		caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
hamlet@67473		it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
hamlet@67522		cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
hamlet@67573		digested in the scenes, set down with as much
hamlet@67620		modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
hamlet@67668		were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
hamlet@67717		savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
hamlet@67766		indict the author of affectation; but called it an
hamlet@67818		honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
hamlet@67869		much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
hamlet@67919		chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
hamlet@67967		thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
hamlet@68016		Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
hamlet@68069		at this line: let me see, let me see--
hamlet@68109		'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
hamlet@68160		it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
hamlet@68202		'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
hamlet@68245		Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
hamlet@68291		When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
hamlet@68334		Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
hamlet@68384		With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
hamlet@68425		Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
hamlet@68466		With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
hamlet@68516		Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
hamlet@68563		That lend a tyrannous and damned light
hamlet@68603		To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
hamlet@68655		And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
hamlet@68697		With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
hamlet@68745		Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
hamlet@68774		So, proceed you.
hamlet@68792
hamlet@68793	LORD POLONIUS	'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
hamlet@68861		good discretion.
hamlet@68879
hamlet@68880	First Player	'Anon he finds him
hamlet@68912		Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
hamlet@68962		Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
hamlet@69007		Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
hamlet@69047		Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
hamlet@69095		But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
hamlet@69142		The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
hamlet@69192		Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
hamlet@69237		Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
hamlet@69283		Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
hamlet@69333		Which was declining on the milky head
hamlet@69372		Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
hamlet@69420		So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
hamlet@69461		And like a neutral to his will and matter,
hamlet@69505		Did nothing.
hamlet@69519		But, as we often see, against some storm,
hamlet@69562		A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
hamlet@69611		The bold winds speechless and the orb below
hamlet@69656		As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
hamlet@69701		Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
hamlet@69750		Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
hamlet@69790		And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
hamlet@69831		On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
hamlet@69873		With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
hamlet@69921		Now falls on Priam.
hamlet@69942		Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
hamlet@69991		In general synod 'take away her power;
hamlet@70031		Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
hamlet@70081		And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
hamlet@70131		As low as to the fiends!'
hamlet@70158
hamlet@70159	LORD POLONIUS	This is too long.
hamlet@70191
hamlet@70192	HAMLET	It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
hamlet@70251		say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
hamlet@70302		sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.
hamlet@70335
hamlet@70336	First Player	'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
hamlet@70395
hamlet@70396	HAMLET	'The mobled queen?'
hamlet@70423
hamlet@70424	LORD POLONIUS	That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
hamlet@70475
hamlet@70476	First Player	'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
hamlet@70539		With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
hamlet@70582		Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
hamlet@70628		About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
hamlet@70671		A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
hamlet@70715		Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
hamlet@70765		'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
hamlet@70809		pronounced:
hamlet@70822		But if the gods themselves did see her then
hamlet@70867		When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
hamlet@70910		In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
hamlet@70958		The instant burst of clamour that she made,
hamlet@71003		Unless things mortal move them not at all,
hamlet@71047		Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
hamlet@71098		And passion in the gods.'
hamlet@71125
hamlet@71126	LORD POLONIUS	Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
hamlet@71191		tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.
hamlet@71228
hamlet@71229	HAMLET	'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
hamlet@71287		Good my lord, will you see the players well
hamlet@71332		bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for
hamlet@71383		they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
hamlet@71434		time: after your death you were better have a bad
hamlet@71485		epitaph than their ill report while you live.
hamlet@71532
hamlet@71533	LORD POLONIUS	My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
hamlet@71599
hamlet@71600	HAMLET	God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
hamlet@71655		after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
hamlet@71706		Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
hamlet@71760		they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
hamlet@71809		Take them in.
hamlet@71824
hamlet@71825	LORD POLONIUS	Come, sirs.
hamlet@71851
hamlet@71852	HAMLET	Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
hamlet@71909
hamlet@71910		[Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First]
hamlet@71962
hamlet@71963		Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the
hamlet@72012		Murder of Gonzago?
hamlet@72032
hamlet@72033	First Player	Ay, my lord.
hamlet@72059
hamlet@72060	HAMLET	We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
hamlet@72118		study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
hamlet@72172		I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
hamlet@72222
hamlet@72223	First Player	Ay, my lord.
hamlet@72249
hamlet@72250	HAMLET	Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
hamlet@72308		not.
hamlet@72314
hamlet@72315		[Exit First Player]
hamlet@72336
hamlet@72337		My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
hamlet@72390		welcome to Elsinore.
hamlet@72412
hamlet@72413	ROSENCRANTZ	Good my lord!
hamlet@72439
hamlet@72440	HAMLET	Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
hamlet@72470
hamlet@72471		[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
hamlet@72510
hamlet@72511			  Now I am alone.
hamlet@72531		O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
hamlet@72572		Is it not monstrous that this player here,
hamlet@72616		But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
hamlet@72658		Could force his soul so to his own conceit
hamlet@72702		That from her working all his visage wann'd,
hamlet@72748		Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
hamlet@72793		A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
hamlet@72841		With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
hamlet@72890		For Hecuba!
hamlet@72903		What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
hamlet@72943		That he should weep for her? What would he do,
hamlet@72991		Had he the motive and the cue for passion
hamlet@73034		That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
hamlet@73084		And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
hamlet@73132		Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
hamlet@73173		Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
hamlet@73214		The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
hamlet@73259		A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
hamlet@73299		Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
hamlet@73344		And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
hamlet@73386		Upon whose property and most dear life
hamlet@73426		A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
hamlet@73468		Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
hamlet@73514		Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
hamlet@73561		Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
hamlet@73617		As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
hamlet@73661		Ha!
hamlet@73666		'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
hamlet@73712		But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
hamlet@73751		To make oppression bitter, or ere this
hamlet@73791		I should have fatted all the region kites
hamlet@73834		With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
hamlet@73883		Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
hamlet@73939		O, vengeance!
hamlet@73954		Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
hamlet@73998		That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
hamlet@74042		Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
hamlet@74086		Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
hamlet@74135		And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
hamlet@74174		A scullion!
hamlet@74187		Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
hamlet@74235		That guilty creatures sitting at a play
hamlet@74276		Have by the very cunning of the scene
hamlet@74315		Been struck so to the soul that presently
hamlet@74358		They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
hamlet@74400		For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
hamlet@74450		With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
hamlet@74503		Play something like the murder of my father
hamlet@74548		Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
hamlet@74592		I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
hamlet@74639		I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
hamlet@74686		May be the devil: and the devil hath power
hamlet@74730		To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
hamlet@74776		Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
hamlet@74815		As he is very potent with such spirits,
hamlet@74856		Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
hamlet@74897		More relative than this: the play 's the thing
hamlet@74945		Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

hamlet@75058

hamlet@75108		OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN]
hamlet@75149
hamlet@75150	KING CLAUDIUS	And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
hamlet@75206		Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
hamlet@75251		Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
hamlet@75293		With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
hamlet@75331
hamlet@75332	ROSENCRANTZ	He does confess he feels himself distracted;
hamlet@75389		But from what cause he will by no means speak.
hamlet@75437
hamlet@75438	GUILDENSTERN	Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
hamlet@75493		But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
hamlet@75535		When we would bring him on to some confession
hamlet@75582		Of his true state.
hamlet@75602
hamlet@75603	QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  Did he receive you well?
hamlet@75661
hamlet@75662	ROSENCRANTZ	Most like a gentleman.
hamlet@75697
hamlet@75698	GUILDENSTERN	But with much forcing of his disposition.
hamlet@75753
hamlet@75754	ROSENCRANTZ	Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
hamlet@75808		Most free in his reply.
hamlet@75833
hamlet@75834	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Did you assay him?
hamlet@75868		To any pastime?
hamlet@75885
hamlet@75886	ROSENCRANTZ	Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
hamlet@75942		We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
hamlet@75992		And there did seem in him a kind of joy
hamlet@76033		To hear of it: they are about the court,
hamlet@76075		And, as I think, they have already order
hamlet@76117		This night to play before him.
hamlet@76149
hamlet@76150	LORD POLONIUS	'Tis most true:
hamlet@76180		And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
hamlet@76227		To hear and see the matter.
hamlet@76256
hamlet@76257	KING CLAUDIUS	With all my heart; and it doth much content me
hamlet@76318		To hear him so inclined.
hamlet@76344		Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
hamlet@76386		And drive his purpose on to these delights.
hamlet@76431
hamlet@76432	ROSENCRANTZ	We shall, my lord.

hamlet@76504	KING CLAUDIUS	                  Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
hamlet@76566		For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
hamlet@76611		That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
hamlet@76653		Affront Ophelia:
hamlet@76671		Her father and myself, lawful espials,
hamlet@76711		Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
hamlet@76759		We may of their encounter frankly judge,
hamlet@76801		And gather by him, as he is behaved,
hamlet@76839		If 't be the affliction of his love or no
hamlet@76882		That thus he suffers for.
hamlet@76909
hamlet@76910	QUEEN GERTRUDE	I shall obey you.
hamlet@76943		And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
hamlet@76982		That your good beauties be the happy cause
hamlet@77026		Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
hamlet@77078		Will bring him to his wonted way again,

hamlet@77526
hamlet@77527	KING CLAUDIUS	[Aside]          O, 'tis too true!
hamlet@77576		How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
hamlet@77631		The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
hamlet@77682		Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
hamlet@77727		Than is my deed to my most painted word:

hamlet@77846
hamlet@77847		[Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS]
hamlet@77884
hamlet@77885		[Enter HAMLET]
hamlet@77901
hamlet@77902	HAMLET	To be, or not to be: that is the question:
hamlet@77952		Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
hamlet@77995		The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
hamlet@78041		Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
hamlet@78085		And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
hamlet@78130		No more; and by a sleep to say we end
hamlet@78169		The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
hamlet@78217		That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
hamlet@78261		Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
hamlet@78303		To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
hamlet@78355		For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
hamlet@78404		When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
hamlet@78449		Must give us pause: there's the respect
hamlet@78490		That makes calamity of so long life;
hamlet@78528		For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
hamlet@78578		The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
hamlet@78629		The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
hamlet@78675		The insolence of office and the spurns
hamlet@78715		That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
hamlet@78758		When he himself might his quietus make
hamlet@78798		With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
hamlet@78843		To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
hamlet@78883		But that the dread of something after death,
hamlet@78929		The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
hamlet@78972		No traveller returns, puzzles the will
hamlet@79012		And makes us rather bear those ills we have
hamlet@79057		Than fly to others that we know not of?
hamlet@79098		Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
hamlet@79144		And thus the native hue of resolution
hamlet@79183		Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
hamlet@79232		And enterprises of great pith and moment
hamlet@79274		With this regard their currents turn awry,
hamlet@79318		And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
hamlet@79363		The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
hamlet@79404		Be all my sins remember'd.
hamlet@79432
hamlet@79433	OPHELIA	Good my lord,
hamlet@79455		How does your honour for this many a day?
hamlet@79498
hamlet@79499	HAMLET	I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
hamlet@79544
hamlet@79545	OPHELIA	My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
hamlet@79592		That I have longed long to re-deliver;
hamlet@79632		I pray you, now receive them.
hamlet@79663
hamlet@79664	HAMLET	No, not I;
hamlet@79682		I never gave you aught.
hamlet@79707
hamlet@79708	OPHELIA	My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
hamlet@79763		And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
hamlet@79814		As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
hamlet@79865		Take these again; for to the noble mind
hamlet@79906		Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
hamlet@79953		There, my lord.
hamlet@79970
hamlet@79971	HAMLET	Ha, ha! are you honest?
hamlet@80002
hamlet@80003	OPHELIA	My lord?
hamlet@80020
hamlet@80021	HAMLET	Are you fair?
hamlet@80042
hamlet@80043	OPHELIA	What means your lordship?
hamlet@80077
hamlet@80078	HAMLET	That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
hamlet@80137		admit no discourse to your beauty.
hamlet@80173
hamlet@80174	OPHELIA	Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
hamlet@80231		with honesty?
hamlet@80246
hamlet@80247	HAMLET	Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
hamlet@80301		transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
hamlet@80355		force of honesty can translate beauty into his
hamlet@80403		likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
hamlet@80455		time gives it proof. I did love you once.
hamlet@80498
hamlet@80499	OPHELIA	Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
hamlet@80548
hamlet@80549	HAMLET	You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
hamlet@80607		so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
hamlet@80658		it: I loved you not.
hamlet@80680
hamlet@80681	OPHELIA	I was the more deceived.
hamlet@80714
hamlet@80715	HAMLET	Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
hamlet@80767		breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
hamlet@80820		but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
hamlet@80870		were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
hamlet@80921		proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
hamlet@80974		my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
hamlet@81020		imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
hamlet@81073		in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
hamlet@81120		between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
hamlet@81169		all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
hamlet@81221		Where's your father?
hamlet@81243
hamlet@81244	OPHELIA	At home, my lord.
hamlet@81270
hamlet@81271	HAMLET	Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
hamlet@81331		fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.
hamlet@81376
hamlet@81377	OPHELIA	O, help him, you sweet heavens!
hamlet@81417
hamlet@81418	HAMLET	If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
hamlet@81476		thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
hamlet@81525		snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
hamlet@81577		nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs
hamlet@81624		marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
hamlet@81676		what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
hamlet@81727		and quickly too. Farewell.
hamlet@81755
hamlet@81756	OPHELIA	O heavenly powers, restore him!
hamlet@81796
hamlet@81797	HAMLET	I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
hamlet@81857		has given you one face, and you make yourselves
hamlet@81906		another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
hamlet@81954		nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness
hamlet@82007		your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath
hamlet@82058		made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
hamlet@82111		those that are married already, all but one, shall
hamlet@82163		live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a
hamlet@82208		nunnery, go.

hamlet@82340		The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
hamlet@82384		The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
hamlet@82429		The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
hamlet@82480		And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
hamlet@82524		That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
hamlet@82566		Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
hamlet@82613		Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
hamlet@82663		That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth

hamlet@82894		Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
hamlet@82946		Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
hamlet@83000		O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
hamlet@83042		And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
hamlet@83085		Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
hamlet@83129		I have in quick determination
hamlet@83160		Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
hamlet@83211		For the demand of our neglected tribute
hamlet@83252		Haply the seas and countries different
hamlet@83292		With variable objects shall expel
hamlet@83327		This something-settled matter in his heart,
hamlet@83372		Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
hamlet@83420		From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
hamlet@83467
hamlet@83468	LORD POLONIUS	It shall do well: but yet do I believe
hamlet@83521		The origin and commencement of his grief
hamlet@83563		Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
hamlet@83610		You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
hamlet@83655		We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
hamlet@83700		But, if you hold it fit, after the play
hamlet@83741		Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
hamlet@83785		To show his grief: let her be round with him;
hamlet@83832		And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
hamlet@83879		Of all their conference. If she find him not,
hamlet@83926		To England send him, or confine him where
hamlet@83969		Your wisdom best shall think.
hamlet@84000
hamlet@84001	KING CLAUDIUS	It shall be so:

hamlet@84174
hamlet@84175	HAMLET	Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
hamlet@84234		you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
hamlet@84287		as many of your players do, I had as lief the
hamlet@84334		town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
hamlet@84385		too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
hamlet@84437		for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
hamlet@84491		the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
hamlet@84545		a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
hamlet@84594		offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
hamlet@84639		periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
hamlet@84691		very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
hamlet@84745		for the most part are capable of nothing but
hamlet@84791		inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
hamlet@84844		a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
hamlet@84890		out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.
hamlet@84929
hamlet@84930	First Player	I warrant your honour.
hamlet@84966
hamlet@84967	HAMLET	Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
hamlet@85027		be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
hamlet@85076		word to the action; with this special o'erstep not
hamlet@85128		the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
hamlet@85181		from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
hamlet@85234		first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
hamlet@85286		mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
hamlet@85340		scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
hamlet@85391		the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
hamlet@85443		or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
hamlet@85492		laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
hamlet@85542		censure of the which one must in your allowance
hamlet@85591		o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
hamlet@85641		players that I have seen play, and heard others
hamlet@85690		praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
hamlet@85743		that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
hamlet@85794		the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
hamlet@85842		strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
hamlet@85893		nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
hamlet@85945		well, they imitated humanity so abominably.

hamlet@85991	First Player	I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,

hamlet@86063	HAMLET	O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
hamlet@86119		your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
hamlet@86173		for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
hamlet@86226		set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
hamlet@86278		too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
hamlet@86325		question of the play be then to be considered:
hamlet@86373		that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
hamlet@86426		in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.

hamlet@86885
hamlet@86886	HORATIO	Here, sweet lord, at your service.
hamlet@86929
hamlet@86930	HAMLET	Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
hamlet@86974		As e'er my conversation coped withal.
hamlet@87013
hamlet@87014	HORATIO	O, my dear lord,--
hamlet@87041
hamlet@87042	HAMLET	                  Nay, do not think I flatter;
hamlet@87096		For what advancement may I hope from thee
hamlet@87139		That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
hamlet@87183		To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
hamlet@87243		No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
hamlet@87289		And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
hamlet@87332		Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
hamlet@87382		Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
hamlet@87429		And could of men distinguish, her election
hamlet@87473		Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
hamlet@87523		As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
hamlet@87572		A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
hamlet@87614		Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
hamlet@87665		Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
hamlet@87715		That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
hamlet@87762		To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
hamlet@87811		That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
hamlet@87861		In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
hamlet@87908		As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
hamlet@87954		There is a play to-night before the king;
hamlet@87997		One scene of it comes near the circumstance
hamlet@88042		Which I have told thee of my father's death:
hamlet@88088		I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
hamlet@88132		Even with the very comment of thy soul
hamlet@88172		Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
hamlet@88215		Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
hamlet@88254		It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
hamlet@88295		And my imaginations are as foul
hamlet@88328		As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
hamlet@88372		For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
hamlet@88413		And after we will both our judgments join
hamlet@88456		In censure of his seeming.
hamlet@88484
hamlet@88485	HORATIO	Well, my lord:
hamlet@88508		If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
hamlet@88560		And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
hamlet@88605
hamlet@88606	HAMLET	They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
hamlet@88658		Get you a place.
hamlet@88676
hamlet@88677		[Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS,
hamlet@88726		QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ,

hamlet@88802
hamlet@88803	KING CLAUDIUS	How fares our cousin Hamlet?
hamlet@88846
hamlet@88847	HAMLET	Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
hamlet@88906		the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
hamlet@88960
hamlet@88961	KING CLAUDIUS	I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
hamlet@89028		are not mine.
hamlet@89043
hamlet@89044	HAMLET	No, nor mine now.
hamlet@89069
hamlet@89070		[To POLONIUS]
hamlet@89085
hamlet@89086		My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
hamlet@89140
hamlet@89141	LORD POLONIUS	That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.
hamlet@89208
hamlet@89209	HAMLET	What did you enact?
hamlet@89236
hamlet@89237	LORD POLONIUS	I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
hamlet@89298		Capitol; Brutus killed me.
hamlet@89326
hamlet@89327	HAMLET	It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
hamlet@89387		there. Be the players ready?
hamlet@89417
hamlet@89418	ROSENCRANTZ	Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
hamlet@89473
hamlet@89474	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
hamlet@89529
hamlet@89530	HAMLET	No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
hamlet@89584
hamlet@89585	LORD POLONIUS	[To KING CLAUDIUS]  O, ho! do you mark that?
hamlet@89644
hamlet@89645	HAMLET	Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
hamlet@89683
hamlet@89684		[Lying down at OPHELIA's feet]
hamlet@89716
hamlet@89717	OPHELIA	No, my lord.

hamlet@89777
hamlet@89778	OPHELIA	Ay, my lord.
hamlet@89799
hamlet@89800	HAMLET	Do you think I meant country matters?
hamlet@89845
hamlet@89846	OPHELIA	I think nothing, my lord.
hamlet@89880
hamlet@89881	HAMLET	That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.

hamlet@89965
hamlet@89966	HAMLET	Nothing.
hamlet@89982

hamlet@90015
hamlet@90016	HAMLET	Who, I?
hamlet@90031
hamlet@90032	OPHELIA	Ay, my lord.
hamlet@90053
hamlet@90054	HAMLET	O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do
hamlet@90110		but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
hamlet@90158		mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
hamlet@90216
hamlet@90217	OPHELIA	Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
hamlet@90262
hamlet@90263	HAMLET	So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
hamlet@90319		I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
hamlet@90367		months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's
hamlet@90416		hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
hamlet@90469		a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
hamlet@90518		then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with

hamlet@90896		upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep,
hamlet@90945		leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
hamlet@90996		crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's
hamlet@91046		ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King
hamlet@91097		dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner,
hamlet@91147		with some two or three Mutes, comes in again,
hamlet@91194		seeming to lament with her. The dead body is

hamlet@91644
hamlet@91645	OPHELIA	Will he tell us what this show meant?
hamlet@91691
hamlet@91692	HAMLET	Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you
hamlet@91748		ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
hamlet@91809

hamlet@92069
hamlet@92070	HAMLET	As woman's love.
hamlet@92094
hamlet@92095		[Enter two Players, King and Queen]
hamlet@92132
hamlet@92133	Player King	   Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
hamlet@92196		Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
hamlet@92243		And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
hamlet@92287		About the world have times twelve thirties been,
hamlet@92337		Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
hamlet@92384		Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
hamlet@92423
hamlet@92424	Player Queen	   So many journeys may the sun and moon
hamlet@92478		Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
hamlet@92522		But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
hamlet@92564		So far from cheer and from your former state,
hamlet@92611		That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
hamlet@92657		Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
hamlet@92700		For women's fear and love holds quantity;
hamlet@92743		In neither aught, or in extremity.
hamlet@92779		Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
hamlet@92828		And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
hamlet@92869		Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
hamlet@92921		Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
hamlet@92977
hamlet@92978	Player King	'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
hamlet@93040		My operant powers their functions leave to do:
hamlet@93088		And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
hamlet@93136		Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
hamlet@93178		For husband shalt thou--
hamlet@93204
hamlet@93205	Player Queen	O, confound the rest!
hamlet@93240		Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
hamlet@93287		In second husband let me be accurst!
hamlet@93325		None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
hamlet@93372
hamlet@93373	HAMLET	[Aside]  Wormwood, wormwood.
hamlet@93409
hamlet@93410	Player Queen	   The instances that second marriage move
hamlet@93466		Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
hamlet@93514		A second time I kill my husband dead,
hamlet@93553		When second husband kisses me in bed.
hamlet@93592
hamlet@93593	Player King	   I do believe you think what now you speak;
hamlet@93651		But what we do determine oft we break.
hamlet@93691		Purpose is but the slave to memory,
hamlet@93728		Of violent birth, but poor validity;
hamlet@93766		Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
hamlet@93817		But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
hamlet@93859		Most necessary 'tis that we forget
hamlet@93895		To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
hamlet@93940		What to ourselves in passion we propose,
hamlet@93982		The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
hamlet@94026		The violence of either grief or joy
hamlet@94063		Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
hamlet@94109		Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
hamlet@94157		Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
hamlet@94204		This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
hamlet@94253		That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
hamlet@94307		For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
hamlet@94350		Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
hamlet@94400		The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
hamlet@94451		The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
hamlet@94496		And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
hamlet@94537		For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
hamlet@94583		And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
hamlet@94626		Directly seasons him his enemy.
hamlet@94659		But, orderly to end where I begun,
hamlet@94695		Our wills and fates do so contrary run
hamlet@94735		That our devices still are overthrown;
hamlet@94775		Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
hamlet@94827		So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
hamlet@94870		But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
hamlet@94921
hamlet@94922	Player Queen	   Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
hamlet@94983		Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
hamlet@95029		To desperation turn my trust and hope!
hamlet@95069		An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
hamlet@95111		Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
hamlet@95154		Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
hamlet@95199		Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
hamlet@95246		If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
hamlet@95281
hamlet@95282	HAMLET	If she should break it now!
hamlet@95317
hamlet@95318	Player King	'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
hamlet@95378		My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
hamlet@95426		The tedious day with sleep.
hamlet@95455
hamlet@95456		[Sleeps]
hamlet@95466
hamlet@95467	Player Queen	Sleep rock thy brain,
hamlet@95502		And never come mischance between us twain!
hamlet@95546

hamlet@95555
hamlet@95556	HAMLET	Madam, how like you this play?
hamlet@95594
hamlet@95595	QUEEN GERTRUDE	The lady protests too much, methinks.
hamlet@95648
hamlet@95649	HAMLET	O, but she'll keep her word.
hamlet@95685
hamlet@95686	KING CLAUDIUS	Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
hamlet@95756
hamlet@95757	HAMLET	No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
hamlet@95817		i' the world.
hamlet@95832
hamlet@95833	KING CLAUDIUS	What do you call the play?
hamlet@95874
hamlet@95875	HAMLET	The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
hamlet@95932		is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is
hamlet@95985		the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see
hamlet@96037		anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
hamlet@96086		that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
hamlet@96138		touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our
hamlet@96186		withers are unwrung.
hamlet@96208
hamlet@96209		[Enter LUCIANUS]
hamlet@96227
hamlet@96228		This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
hamlet@96271
hamlet@96272	OPHELIA	You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
hamlet@96318
hamlet@96319	HAMLET	I could interpret between you and your love, if I
hamlet@96376		could see the puppets dallying.
hamlet@96409
hamlet@96410	OPHELIA	You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
hamlet@96455
hamlet@96456	HAMLET	It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
hamlet@96513
hamlet@96514	OPHELIA	Still better, and worse.
hamlet@96547
hamlet@96548	HAMLET	So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
hamlet@96604		pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
hamlet@96653		'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'
hamlet@96700
hamlet@96701	LUCIANUS	   Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
hamlet@96770		Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
hamlet@96816		Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
hamlet@96865		With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
hamlet@96917		Thy natural magic and dire property,
hamlet@96955		On wholesome life usurp immediately.
hamlet@96993
hamlet@96994		[Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears]
hamlet@97038
hamlet@97039	HAMLET	He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His
hamlet@97093		name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in
hamlet@97143		choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer
hamlet@97196		gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
hamlet@97230
hamlet@97231	OPHELIA	The king rises.
hamlet@97255
hamlet@97256	HAMLET	What, frighted with false fire!
hamlet@97295
hamlet@97296	QUEEN GERTRUDE	How fares my lord?
hamlet@97330
hamlet@97331	LORD POLONIUS	Give o'er the play.
hamlet@97365
hamlet@97366	KING CLAUDIUS	Give me some light: away!
hamlet@97406
hamlet@97407	All	Lights, lights, lights!
hamlet@97435
hamlet@97436		[Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIO]
hamlet@97473
hamlet@97474	HAMLET	     Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
hamlet@97522		The hart ungalled play;
hamlet@97547		For some must watch, while some must sleep:
hamlet@97592		So runs the world away.
hamlet@97617		Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if
hamlet@97669		the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two
hamlet@97722		Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a
hamlet@97768		fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
hamlet@97806
hamlet@97807	HORATIO	Half a share.
hamlet@97829
hamlet@97830	HAMLET	A whole one, I.
hamlet@97853		For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
hamlet@97888		This realm dismantled was
hamlet@97915		Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
hamlet@97953		A very, very--pajock.
hamlet@97976
hamlet@97977	HORATIO	You might have rhymed.
hamlet@98008
hamlet@98009	HAMLET	O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
hamlet@98065		thousand pound. Didst perceive?
hamlet@98098
hamlet@98099	HORATIO	Very well, my lord.
hamlet@98127
hamlet@98128	HAMLET	Upon the talk of the poisoning?
hamlet@98167
hamlet@98168	HORATIO	I did very well note him.
hamlet@98202
hamlet@98203	HAMLET	Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
hamlet@98257		For if the king like not the comedy,
hamlet@98295		Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
hamlet@98338		Come, some music!
hamlet@98357
hamlet@98358		[Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
hamlet@98399
hamlet@98400	GUILDENSTERN	Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
hamlet@98457
hamlet@98458	HAMLET	Sir, a whole history.
hamlet@98487
hamlet@98488	GUILDENSTERN	The king, sir,--
hamlet@98518
hamlet@98519	HAMLET	Ay, sir, what of him?
hamlet@98548
hamlet@98549	GUILDENSTERN	Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
hamlet@98607
hamlet@98608	HAMLET	With drink, sir?
hamlet@98632
hamlet@98633	GUILDENSTERN	No, my lord, rather with choler.
hamlet@98679
hamlet@98680	HAMLET	Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
hamlet@98733		signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him
hamlet@98785		to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
hamlet@98837		more choler.
hamlet@98851
hamlet@98852	GUILDENSTERN	Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
hamlet@98918		start not so wildly from my affair.
hamlet@98955
hamlet@98956	HAMLET	I am tame, sir: pronounce.
hamlet@98990
hamlet@98991	GUILDENSTERN	The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
hamlet@99056		spirit, hath sent me to you.
hamlet@99086
hamlet@99087	HAMLET	You are welcome.
hamlet@99111
hamlet@99112	GUILDENSTERN	Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
hamlet@99178		breed. If it shall please you to make me a
hamlet@99222		wholesome answer, I will do your mother's
hamlet@99265		commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
hamlet@99313		shall be the end of my business.
hamlet@99347
hamlet@99348	HAMLET	Sir, I cannot.
hamlet@99370
hamlet@99371	GUILDENSTERN	What, my lord?
hamlet@99399
hamlet@99400	HAMLET	Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
hamlet@99460		sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
hamlet@99512		or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no
hamlet@99561		more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--
hamlet@99609
hamlet@99610	ROSENCRANTZ	Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
hamlet@99672		into amazement and admiration.
hamlet@99704
hamlet@99705	HAMLET	O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
hamlet@99764		is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's
hamlet@99814		admiration? Impart.
hamlet@99835
hamlet@99836	ROSENCRANTZ	She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
hamlet@99901		go to bed.
hamlet@99913
hamlet@99914	HAMLET	We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have
hamlet@99972		you any further trade with us?
hamlet@100004
hamlet@100005	ROSENCRANTZ	My lord, you once did love me.
hamlet@100048
hamlet@100049	HAMLET	So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
hamlet@100102

hamlet@100166		do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if
hamlet@100218		you deny your griefs to your friend.
hamlet@100256
hamlet@100257	HAMLET	Sir, I lack advancement.
hamlet@100289
hamlet@100290	ROSENCRANTZ	How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
hamlet@100355		himself for your succession in Denmark?
hamlet@100396
hamlet@100397	HAMLET	Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
hamlet@100455		is something musty.

hamlet@100658
hamlet@100659	GUILDENSTERN	O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
hamlet@100723		unmannerly.
hamlet@100736

hamlet@100922	GUILDENSTERN	I know no touch of it, my lord.
hamlet@100967
hamlet@100968	HAMLET	'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
hamlet@101025		your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your
hamlet@101075		mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
hamlet@101126		Look you, these are the stops.
hamlet@101158
hamlet@101159	GUILDENSTERN	But these cannot I command to any utterance of
hamlet@101219		harmony; I have not the skill.
hamlet@101251
hamlet@101252	HAMLET	Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
hamlet@101311		me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
hamlet@101363		my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
hamlet@101410		mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
hamlet@101462		the top of my compass: and there is much music,
hamlet@101511		excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
hamlet@101562		you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
hamlet@101609		easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
hamlet@101659		instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you
hamlet@101713		cannot play upon me.

hamlet@101915
hamlet@101916	LORD POLONIUS	By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
hamlet@101974

hamlet@102012
hamlet@102013	LORD POLONIUS	It is backed like a weasel.

hamlet@102080
hamlet@102081	LORD POLONIUS	Very like a whale.
hamlet@102114

hamlet@104438		And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
hamlet@104481		'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,

hamlet@104752
hamlet@104753		O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
hamlet@104797		It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
hamlet@104838		A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
hamlet@104875		Though inclination be as sharp as will:
hamlet@104916		My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
hamlet@104961		And, like a man to double business bound,
hamlet@105004		I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
hamlet@105049		And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
hamlet@105093		Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
hamlet@105141		Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
hamlet@105188		To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
hamlet@105236		But to confront the visage of offence?
hamlet@105276		And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
hamlet@105323		To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
hamlet@105363		Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
hamlet@105407		My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
hamlet@105454		Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
hamlet@105503		That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
hamlet@105547		Of those effects for which I did the murder,
hamlet@105593		My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
hamlet@105636		May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
hamlet@105681		In the corrupted currents of this world
hamlet@105722		Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
hamlet@105767		And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
hamlet@105810		Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
hamlet@105852		There is no shuffling, there the action lies
hamlet@105898		In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
hamlet@105947		Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
hamlet@105994		To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
hamlet@106039		Try what repentance can: what can it not?
hamlet@106082		Yet what can it when one can not repent?
hamlet@106124		O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
hamlet@106167		O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
hamlet@106211		Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
hamlet@106256		Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
hamlet@106312		Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!

hamlet@106552		A villain kills my father; and for that,
hamlet@106594		I, his sole son, do this same villain send
hamlet@106638		To heaven.
hamlet@106650		O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
hamlet@106692		He took my father grossly, full of bread;
hamlet@106735		With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
hamlet@106786		And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
hamlet@106835		But in our circumstance and course of thought,
hamlet@106883		'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,

hamlet@107016		No!
hamlet@107021		Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
hamlet@107067		When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
hamlet@107109		Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
hamlet@107152		At gaming, swearing, or about some act
hamlet@107192		That has no relish of salvation in't;
hamlet@107231		Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,

hamlet@110572		Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
hamlet@110618		An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
hamlet@110662		A station like the herald Mercury
hamlet@110697		New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
hamlet@110736		A combination and a form indeed,
hamlet@110770		Where every god did seem to set his seal,

hamlet@110852		This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:

hamlet@110948		Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
hamlet@110996		Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
hamlet@111044		And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
hamlet@111089		You cannot call it love; for at your age
hamlet@111131		The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
hamlet@111179		And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
hamlet@111227		Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
hamlet@111281		Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
hamlet@111335		Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
hamlet@111377		Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
hamlet@111421		But it reserved some quantity of choice,
hamlet@111463		To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
hamlet@111512		That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
hamlet@111558		Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
hamlet@111604		Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
hamlet@111652		Or but a sickly part of one true sense
hamlet@111692		Could not so mope.
hamlet@111712		O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
hamlet@111759		If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
hamlet@111802		To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
hamlet@111842		And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
hamlet@111887		When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,

hamlet@113538		Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
hamlet@113583		Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
hamlet@113625		Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
hamlet@113671
hamlet@113672	HAMLET	On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
hamlet@113725		His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
hamlet@113777		Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
hamlet@113824		Lest with this piteous action you convert
hamlet@113867		My stern effects: then what I have to do
hamlet@113909		Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
hamlet@113960
hamlet@113961	QUEEN GERTRUDE	To whom do you speak this?
hamlet@114003
hamlet@114004	HAMLET	Do you see nothing there?
hamlet@114037
hamlet@114038	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
hamlet@114092
hamlet@114093	HAMLET	Nor did you nothing hear?
hamlet@114126
hamlet@114127	QUEEN GERTRUDE	No, nothing but ourselves.
hamlet@114169
hamlet@114170	HAMLET	Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
hamlet@114224		My father, in his habit as he lived!

hamlet@114413		Is very cunning in.
hamlet@114434
hamlet@114435	HAMLET	Ecstasy!
hamlet@114451		My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
hamlet@114500		And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
hamlet@114549		That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
hamlet@114593		And I the matter will re-word; which madness
hamlet@114639		Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
hamlet@114686		Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
hamlet@114732		That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
hamlet@114780		It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
hamlet@114827		Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
hamlet@114871		Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
hamlet@114916		Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
hamlet@114960		And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
hamlet@115005		To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
hamlet@115054		For in the fatness of these pursy times
hamlet@115095		Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
hamlet@115135		Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
hamlet@115180
hamlet@115181	QUEEN GERTRUDE	O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
hamlet@115241
hamlet@115242	HAMLET	O, throw away the worser part of it,
hamlet@115286		And live the purer with the other half.
hamlet@115327		Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
hamlet@115372		Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
hamlet@115410		That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
hamlet@115457		Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
hamlet@115497		That to the use of actions fair and good
hamlet@115539		He likewise gives a frock or livery,
hamlet@115577		That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
hamlet@115618		And that shall lend a kind of easiness
hamlet@115658		To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
hamlet@115703		For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
hamlet@115751		And either [         ] the devil, or throw him out
hamlet@115803		With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
hamlet@115850		And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
hamlet@115892		I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
hamlet@115939
hamlet@115940		[Pointing to POLONIUS]
hamlet@115964
hamlet@115965		I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
hamlet@116010		To punish me with this and this with me,
hamlet@116052		That I must be their scourge and minister.
hamlet@116096		I will bestow him, and will answer well
hamlet@116137		The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
hamlet@116183		I must be cruel, only to be kind:
hamlet@116218		Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
hamlet@116261		One word more, good lady.
hamlet@116288
hamlet@116289	QUEEN GERTRUDE	What shall I do?
hamlet@116321
hamlet@116322	HAMLET	Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
hamlet@116371		Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
hamlet@116415		Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
hamlet@116464		And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
hamlet@116507		Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
hamlet@116558		Make you to ravel all this matter out,
hamlet@116598		That I essentially am not in madness,
hamlet@116637		But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
hamlet@116686		For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
hamlet@116735		Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
hamlet@116777		Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
hamlet@116823		No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
hamlet@116861		Unpeg the basket on the house's top.
hamlet@116899		Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
hamlet@116945		To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
hamlet@116987		And break your own neck down.
hamlet@117018
hamlet@117019	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
hamlet@117079		And breath of life, I have no life to breathe

hamlet@117406		And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
hamlet@117447		For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
hamlet@117488		Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
hamlet@117537		But I will delve one yard below their mines,
hamlet@117583		And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
hamlet@117631		When in one line two crafts directly meet.
hamlet@117675		This man shall set me packing:
hamlet@117707		I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
hamlet@117751		Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
hamlet@117795		Is now most still, most secret and most grave,

hamlet@121195		an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to

hamlet@126181		That hath in it no profit but the name.
hamlet@126222		To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
hamlet@126270		Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
hamlet@126311		A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
hamlet@126353
hamlet@126354	HAMLET	Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
hamlet@126404
hamlet@126405	Captain	Yes, it is already garrison'd.
hamlet@126444
hamlet@126445	HAMLET	Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
hamlet@126498		Will not debate the question of this straw:
hamlet@126543		This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
hamlet@126593		That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
hamlet@126641		Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.

hamlet@126849
hamlet@126850		How all occasions do inform against me,
hamlet@126891		And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
hamlet@126933		If his chief good and market of his time
hamlet@126975		Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
hamlet@127020		Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
hamlet@127070		Looking before and after, gave us not
hamlet@127109		That capability and god-like reason
hamlet@127146		To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
hamlet@127188		Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
hamlet@127230		Of thinking too precisely on the event,
hamlet@127271		A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
hamlet@127325		And ever three parts coward, I do not know
hamlet@127369		Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
hamlet@127414		Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
hamlet@127465		To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
hamlet@127510		Witness this army of such mass and charge
hamlet@127553		Led by a delicate and tender prince,
hamlet@127591		Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
hamlet@127633		Makes mouths at the invisible event,
hamlet@127671		Exposing what is mortal and unsure
hamlet@127707		To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
hamlet@127752		Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
hamlet@127796		Is not to stir without great argument,
hamlet@127836		But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
hamlet@127876		When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
hamlet@127923		That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
hamlet@127969		Excitements of my reason and my blood,
hamlet@128009		And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
hamlet@128055		The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
hamlet@128099		That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
hamlet@128139		Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
hamlet@128187		Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
hamlet@128230		Which is not tomb enough and continent
hamlet@128270		To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,

hamlet@131605

hamlet@131655		All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
hamlet@131707		When sorrows come, they come not single spies
hamlet@131754		But in battalions. First, her father slain:
hamlet@131799		Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
hamlet@131848		Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
hamlet@131893		Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
hamlet@131948		For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
hamlet@132005		In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
hamlet@132050		Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
hamlet@132095		Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
hamlet@132147		Last, and as much containing as all these,
hamlet@132191		Her brother is in secret come from France;
hamlet@132235		Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
hamlet@132282		And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
hamlet@132323		With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
hamlet@132371		Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
hamlet@132411		Will nothing stick our person to arraign
hamlet@132453		In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
hamlet@132496		Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
hamlet@132539		Gives me superfluous death.

hamlet@132815		Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
hamlet@132861		Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
hamlet@132901		O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;

hamlet@133738	LAERTES	That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
hamlet@133799		Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot

hamlet@133893		Of my true mother.
hamlet@133913
hamlet@133914	KING CLAUDIUS	                  What is the cause, Laertes,
hamlet@133974		That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
hamlet@134015		Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
hamlet@134062		There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
hamlet@134104		That treason can but peep to what it would,
hamlet@134149		Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
hamlet@134193		Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.
hamlet@134244		Speak, man.
hamlet@134257
hamlet@134258	LAERTES	Where is my father?
hamlet@134286
hamlet@134287	KING CLAUDIUS	Dead.
hamlet@134307

hamlet@134339
hamlet@134340	KING CLAUDIUS	Let him demand his fill.
hamlet@134379
hamlet@134380	LAERTES	How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
hamlet@134432		To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
hamlet@134483		Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
hamlet@134530		I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
hamlet@134572		That both the worlds I give to negligence,
hamlet@134616		Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged
hamlet@134660		Most thoroughly for my father.
hamlet@134692
hamlet@134693	KING CLAUDIUS	Who shall stay you?
hamlet@134727
hamlet@134728	LAERTES	My will, not all the world:
hamlet@134764		And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
hamlet@134810		They shall go far with little.
hamlet@134842
hamlet@134843	KING CLAUDIUS	Good Laertes,
hamlet@134871		If you desire to know the certainty
hamlet@134908		Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
hamlet@134965		That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
hamlet@135019		Winner and loser?
hamlet@135038
hamlet@135039	LAERTES	None but his enemies.
hamlet@135069
hamlet@135070	KING CLAUDIUS	Will you know them then?
hamlet@135109
hamlet@135110	LAERTES	To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
hamlet@135166		And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
hamlet@135209		Repast them with my blood.
hamlet@135237
hamlet@135238	KING CLAUDIUS	Why, now you speak
hamlet@135271		Like a good child and a true gentleman.
hamlet@135312		That I am guiltless of your father's death,
hamlet@135357		And am most sensible in grief for it,
hamlet@135396		It shall as level to your judgment pierce
hamlet@135439		As day does to your eye.

hamlet@135763		Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
hamlet@135803		O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
hamlet@135850		Should be as moral as an old man's life?
hamlet@135892		Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,

hamlet@136745		herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with
hamlet@136799		a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you
hamlet@136848		some violets, but they withered all when my father

hamlet@137228

hamlet@140520	KING CLAUDIUS	O, for two special reasons;
hamlet@140562		Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
hamlet@140611		But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
hamlet@140664		Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
hamlet@140709		My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
hamlet@140755		She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
hamlet@140798		That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
hamlet@140846		I could not but by her. The other motive,
hamlet@140889		Why to a public count I might not go,
hamlet@140928		Is the great love the general gender bear him;
hamlet@140976		Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
hamlet@141025		Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,

hamlet@143747

hamlet@143841		The light and careless livery that it wears
hamlet@143886		Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
hamlet@143930		Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
hamlet@143981		Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
hamlet@144018		I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
hamlet@144069		And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
hamlet@144119		Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;

hamlet@144537		And gem of all the nation.
hamlet@144565

hamlet@144682		And for your rapier most especially,
hamlet@144720		That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
hamlet@144767		If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
hamlet@144822		He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,

hamlet@145221
hamlet@145222	LAERTES	Why ask you this?
hamlet@145248
hamlet@145249	KING CLAUDIUS	Not that I think you did not love your father;
hamlet@145310		But that I know love is begun by time;
hamlet@145350		And that I see, in passages of proof,
hamlet@145389		Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
hamlet@145431		There lives within the very flame of love
hamlet@145474		A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
hamlet@145519		And nothing is at a like goodness still;
hamlet@145561		For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
hamlet@145598		Dies in his own too much: that we would do
hamlet@145642		We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
hamlet@145696		And hath abatements and delays as many
hamlet@145736		As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
hamlet@145785		And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
hamlet@145837		That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
hamlet@145894		Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
hamlet@145940		To show yourself your father's son in deed
hamlet@145984		More than in words?
hamlet@146005
hamlet@146006	LAERTES	To cut his throat i' the church.
hamlet@146047
hamlet@146048	KING CLAUDIUS	No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;

hamlet@146158		Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
hamlet@146209		Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:

hamlet@146305		And set a double varnish on the fame
hamlet@146343		The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
hamlet@146395		And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
hamlet@146439		Most generous and free from all contriving,
hamlet@146484		Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
hamlet@146532		Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
hamlet@146576		A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
hamlet@146620		Requite him for your father.
hamlet@146650
hamlet@146651	LAERTES	I will do't:
hamlet@146672		And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
hamlet@146718		I bought an unction of a mountebank,
hamlet@146756		So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
hamlet@146796		Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
hamlet@146840		Collected from all simples that have virtue
hamlet@146885		Under the moon, can save the thing from death
hamlet@146932		That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
hamlet@146983		With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
hamlet@147035		It may be death.

hamlet@147162		May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
hamlet@147209		And that our drift look through our bad performance,
hamlet@147263		'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
hamlet@147314		Should have a back or second, that might hold,
hamlet@147362		If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
hamlet@147412		We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
hamlet@147465		When in your motion you are hot and dry--
hamlet@147508		As make your bouts more violent to that end--
hamlet@147555		And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him

hamlet@148359		Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;

hamlet@148504		As one incapable of her own distress,

hamlet@152643		But age, with his stealing steps,
hamlet@152678		Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
hamlet@152709		And hath shipped me intil the land,

hamlet@152776
hamlet@152777		[Throws up a skull]
hamlet@152798
hamlet@152799	HAMLET	That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
hamlet@152858		how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were
hamlet@152911		Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
hamlet@152959		might be the pate of a politician, which this ass
hamlet@153010		now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,
hamlet@153060		might it not?
hamlet@153075
hamlet@153076	HORATIO	It might, my lord.
hamlet@153103
hamlet@153104	HAMLET	Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,
hamlet@153159		sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might
hamlet@153210		be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord
hamlet@153255		such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?
hamlet@153315
hamlet@153316	HORATIO	Ay, my lord.
hamlet@153337
hamlet@153338	HAMLET	Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and
hamlet@153397		knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:
hamlet@153447		here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to
hamlet@153495		see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,
hamlet@153546		but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.
hamlet@153605
hamlet@153606	First Clown: [Sings]

hamlet@153751
hamlet@153752		[Throws up another skull]
hamlet@153779
hamlet@153780	HAMLET	There's another: why may not that be the skull of a
hamlet@153839		lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
hamlet@153891		his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he
hamlet@153944		suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
hamlet@153995		sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of
hamlet@154049		his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be
hamlet@154099		in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
hamlet@154152		his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
hamlet@154204		his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and
hamlet@154256		the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
hamlet@154306		pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him
hamlet@154359		no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than
hamlet@154412		the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The
hamlet@154465		very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
hamlet@154515		this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?

hamlet@155099
hamlet@155100	HAMLET	'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
hamlet@155160		'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.

hamlet@155525
hamlet@155526	HAMLET	How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
hamlet@155581		card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
hamlet@155631		Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
hamlet@155682		it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
hamlet@155734		peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he
hamlet@155786		gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a
hamlet@155829		grave-maker?
hamlet@155843
hamlet@155844	First Clown	Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day
hamlet@155906		that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
hamlet@155954
hamlet@155955	HAMLET	How long is that since?
hamlet@155986
hamlet@155987	First Clown	Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
hamlet@156050		was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
hamlet@156104		is mad, and sent into England.
hamlet@156136
hamlet@156137	HAMLET	Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
hamlet@156185
hamlet@156186	First Clown	Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
hamlet@156249		there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
hamlet@156303
hamlet@156304	HAMLET	Why?
hamlet@156316
hamlet@156317	First Clown	'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men
hamlet@156379		are as mad as he.
hamlet@156398
hamlet@156399	HAMLET	How came he mad?
hamlet@156423
hamlet@156424	First Clown	Very strangely, they say.
hamlet@156462
hamlet@156463	HAMLET	How strangely?
hamlet@156485
hamlet@156486	First Clown	Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
hamlet@156532
hamlet@156533	HAMLET	Upon what ground?
hamlet@156558
hamlet@156559	First Clown	Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
hamlet@156622		and boy, thirty years.
hamlet@156646
hamlet@156647	HAMLET	How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
hamlet@156703
hamlet@156704	First Clown	I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
hamlet@156767		have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
hamlet@156820		hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year
hamlet@156874		or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.
hamlet@156923
hamlet@156924	HAMLET	Why he more than another?
hamlet@156957
hamlet@156958	First Clown	Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
hamlet@157023		he will keep out water a great while; and your water
hamlet@157077		is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
hamlet@157124		Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
hamlet@157178		three and twenty years.
hamlet@157203
hamlet@157204	HAMLET	Whose was it?
hamlet@157225
hamlet@157226	First Clown	A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
hamlet@157297
hamlet@157298	HAMLET	Nay, I know not.
hamlet@157322
hamlet@157323	First Clown	A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
hamlet@157384		flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
hamlet@157437		sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.
hamlet@157482
hamlet@157483	HAMLET	This?
hamlet@157496
hamlet@157497	First Clown	E'en that.

hamlet@157521	HAMLET	Let me see.
hamlet@157540
hamlet@157541		[Takes the skull]
hamlet@157560
hamlet@157561		Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
hamlet@157611		of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath
hamlet@157663		borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how
hamlet@157716		abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at
hamlet@157768		it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
hamlet@157820		not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your
hamlet@157864		gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
hamlet@157913		that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one
hamlet@157965		now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
hamlet@158017		Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let
hamlet@158070		her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must
hamlet@158120		come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell
hamlet@158174		me one thing.
hamlet@158189
hamlet@158190	HORATIO	What's that, my lord?
hamlet@158220
hamlet@158221	HAMLET	Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'

hamlet@158361
hamlet@158362	HORATIO	E'en so, my lord.
hamlet@158388
hamlet@158389	HAMLET	To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may
hamlet@158446		not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
hamlet@158498		till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
hamlet@158537
hamlet@158538	HORATIO	'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
hamlet@158596
hamlet@158597	HAMLET	No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
hamlet@158657		modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as
hamlet@158704		thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
hamlet@158749		Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
hamlet@158803		earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he
hamlet@158857		was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
hamlet@158908		Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
hamlet@158952		Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
hamlet@158994		O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
hamlet@159044		Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!

hamlet@159788		She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
hamlet@159835		Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,

hamlet@160046
hamlet@160047	LAERTES	Must there no more be done?
hamlet@160083
hamlet@160084	First Priest	No more be done:
hamlet@160114		We should profane the service of the dead
hamlet@160157		To sing a requiem and such rest to her
hamlet@160197		As to peace-parted souls.
hamlet@160224
hamlet@160225	LAERTES	Lay her i' the earth:
hamlet@160255		And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
hamlet@160295		May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
hamlet@160346		A ministering angel shall my sister be,

hamlet@163389		[Enter HAMLET and HORATIO]
hamlet@163417
hamlet@163418	HAMLET	So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
hamlet@163477		You do remember all the circumstance?
hamlet@163516
hamlet@163517	HORATIO	Remember it, my lord?
hamlet@163547
hamlet@163548	HAMLET	Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
hamlet@163602		That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
hamlet@163648		Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
hamlet@163696		And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
hamlet@163742		Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
hamlet@163786		When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
hamlet@163841		There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
hamlet@163883		Rough-hew them how we will,--
hamlet@163914
hamlet@163915	HORATIO	That is most certain.
hamlet@163945
hamlet@163946	HAMLET	Up from my cabin,
hamlet@163971		My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
hamlet@164014		Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
hamlet@164057		Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
hamlet@164102		To mine own room again; making so bold,
hamlet@164143		My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
hamlet@164183		Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
hamlet@164234		O royal knavery!--an exact command,
hamlet@164271		Larded with many several sorts of reasons
hamlet@164314		Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
hamlet@164361		With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
hamlet@164406		That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
hamlet@164449		No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
hamlet@164491		My head should be struck off.
hamlet@164522
hamlet@164523	HORATIO	Is't possible?
hamlet@164546
hamlet@164547	HAMLET	Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
hamlet@164602		But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
hamlet@164644
hamlet@164645	HORATIO	I beseech you.
hamlet@164668
hamlet@164669	HAMLET	Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
hamlet@164721		Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
hamlet@164764		They had begun the play--I sat me down,
hamlet@164805		Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
hamlet@164847		I once did hold it, as our statists do,
hamlet@164888		A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
hamlet@164932		How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
hamlet@164976		It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
hamlet@165020		The effect of what I wrote?
hamlet@165049
hamlet@165050	HORATIO	Ay, good my lord.
hamlet@165076
hamlet@165077	HAMLET	An earnest conjuration from the king,
hamlet@165122		As England was his faithful tributary,
hamlet@165162		As love between them like the palm might flourish,
hamlet@165214		As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
hamlet@165262		And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
hamlet@165303		And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
hamlet@165347		That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
hamlet@165397		Without debatement further, more or less,

hamlet@165628		Which was the model of that Danish seal;
hamlet@165670		Folded the writ up in form of the other,
hamlet@165712		Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
hamlet@165769		The changeling never known. Now, the next day
hamlet@165816		Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
hamlet@165865		Thou know'st already.
hamlet@165888
hamlet@165889	HORATIO	So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
hamlet@165938
hamlet@165939	HAMLET	Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
hamlet@165995		They are not near my conscience; their defeat
hamlet@166042		Does by their own insinuation grow:
hamlet@166079		'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
hamlet@166123		Between the pass and fell incensed points
hamlet@166166		Of mighty opposites.
hamlet@166188
hamlet@166189	HORATIO	Why, what a king is this!
hamlet@166223
hamlet@166224	HAMLET	Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
hamlet@166279		He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
hamlet@166330		Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
hamlet@166376		Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
hamlet@166418		And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
hamlet@166472		To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
hamlet@166527		To let this canker of our nature come
hamlet@166566		In further evil?
hamlet@166584
hamlet@166585	HORATIO	It must be shortly known to him from England
hamlet@166638		What is the issue of the business there.
hamlet@166680
hamlet@166681	HAMLET	It will be short: the interim is mine;
hamlet@166727		And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
hamlet@166774		But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
hamlet@166810		That to Laertes I forgot myself;
hamlet@166844		For, by the image of my cause, I see
hamlet@166882		The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
hamlet@166931		But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
hamlet@166979		Into a towering passion.
hamlet@167005
hamlet@167006	HORATIO	Peace! who comes here?
hamlet@167037
hamlet@167038		[Enter OSRIC]
hamlet@167053
hamlet@167054	OSRIC	Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
hamlet@167108
hamlet@167109	HAMLET	I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
hamlet@167167
hamlet@167168	HORATIO	No, my good lord.
hamlet@167194
hamlet@167195	HAMLET	Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
hamlet@167253		know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
hamlet@167302		beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
hamlet@167356		the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
hamlet@167404		spacious in the possession of dirt.
hamlet@167441
hamlet@167442	OSRIC	Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
hamlet@167496		should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
hamlet@167544
hamlet@167545	HAMLET	I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
hamlet@167598		spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
hamlet@167660
hamlet@167661	OSRIC	I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
hamlet@167706
hamlet@167707	HAMLET	No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
hamlet@167758		northerly.
hamlet@167770
hamlet@167771	OSRIC	It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
hamlet@167818
hamlet@167819	HAMLET	But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
hamlet@167876		complexion.
hamlet@167889
hamlet@167890	OSRIC	Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as
hamlet@167941		'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
hamlet@167988		majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
hamlet@168039		great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--
hamlet@168093
hamlet@168094	HAMLET	I beseech you, remember--
hamlet@168127
hamlet@168128		[HAMLET moves him to put on his hat]
hamlet@168166
hamlet@168167	OSRIC	Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
hamlet@168222		Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
hamlet@168273		me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
hamlet@168324		differences, of very soft society and great showing:
hamlet@168378		indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
hamlet@168432		calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
hamlet@168483		continent of what part a gentleman would see.
hamlet@168530
hamlet@168531	HAMLET	Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
hamlet@168587		though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
hamlet@168638		dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
hamlet@168687		neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
hamlet@168739		verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
hamlet@168788		great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
hamlet@168840		rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
hamlet@168888		semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
hamlet@168939		him, his umbrage, nothing more.
hamlet@168972
hamlet@168973	OSRIC	Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
hamlet@169024
hamlet@169025	HAMLET	The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
hamlet@169083		in our more rawer breath?
hamlet@169110
hamlet@169111	OSRIC	Sir?
hamlet@169122
hamlet@169123	HORATIO	Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
hamlet@169182		You will do't, sir, really.
hamlet@169211
hamlet@169212	HAMLET	What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
hamlet@169266
hamlet@169267	OSRIC	Of Laertes?
hamlet@169285
hamlet@169286	HORATIO	His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
hamlet@169352
hamlet@169353	HAMLET	Of him, sir.
hamlet@169373
hamlet@169374	OSRIC	I know you are not ignorant--
hamlet@169410
hamlet@169411	HAMLET	I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
hamlet@169467		it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
hamlet@169509
hamlet@169510	OSRIC	You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
hamlet@169569
hamlet@169570	HAMLET	I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
hamlet@169629		him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
hamlet@169682		know himself.
hamlet@169697
hamlet@169698	OSRIC	I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
hamlet@169755		laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
hamlet@169806
hamlet@169807	HAMLET	What's his weapon?
hamlet@169833
hamlet@169834	OSRIC	Rapier and dagger.
hamlet@169859
hamlet@169860	HAMLET	That's two of his weapons: but, well.
hamlet@169905
hamlet@169906	OSRIC	The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
hamlet@169961		horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
hamlet@170014		it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
hamlet@170063		assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
hamlet@170114		carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
hamlet@170165		responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
hamlet@170216		and of very liberal conceit.
hamlet@170246
hamlet@170247	HAMLET	What call you the carriages?
hamlet@170283
hamlet@170284	HORATIO	I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
hamlet@170352
hamlet@170353	OSRIC	The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
hamlet@170396
hamlet@170397	HAMLET	The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
hamlet@170457		could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
hamlet@170508		be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
hamlet@170559		against six French swords, their assigns, and three
hamlet@170612		liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
hamlet@170664		against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
hamlet@170724
hamlet@170725	OSRIC	The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
hamlet@170780		between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
hamlet@170831		three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
hamlet@170884		would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
hamlet@170933		would vouchsafe the answer.
hamlet@170962
hamlet@170963	HAMLET	How if I answer 'no'?
hamlet@170992
hamlet@170993	OSRIC	I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
hamlet@171056
hamlet@171057	HAMLET	Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
hamlet@171116		majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
hamlet@171170		the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
hamlet@171224		king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
hamlet@171277		if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
hamlet@171337
hamlet@171338	OSRIC	Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
hamlet@171376
hamlet@171377	HAMLET	To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
hamlet@171443
hamlet@171444	OSRIC	I commend my duty to your lordship.
hamlet@171486
hamlet@171487	HAMLET	Yours, yours.
hamlet@171508
hamlet@171509		[Exit OSRIC]
hamlet@171523
hamlet@171524		He does well to commend it himself; there are no
hamlet@171574		tongues else for's turn.
hamlet@171600
hamlet@171601	HORATIO	This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
hamlet@171660
hamlet@171661	HAMLET	He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
hamlet@171717		Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
hamlet@171769		know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
hamlet@171821		the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
hamlet@171873		yesty collection, which carries them through and
hamlet@171923		through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do
hamlet@171976		but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.
hamlet@172028
hamlet@172029		[Enter a Lord]
hamlet@172045
hamlet@172046	Lord	My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
hamlet@172102		Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
hamlet@172156		the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
hamlet@172209		play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
hamlet@172264
hamlet@172265	HAMLET	I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
hamlet@172324		pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now
hamlet@172377		or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
hamlet@172423
hamlet@172424	Lord	The king and queen and all are coming down.
hamlet@172473
hamlet@172474	HAMLET	In happy time.
hamlet@172496
hamlet@172497	Lord	The queen desires you to use some gentle
hamlet@172543		entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
hamlet@172594
hamlet@172595	HAMLET	She well instructs me.
hamlet@172625
hamlet@172626		[Exit Lord]
hamlet@172639
hamlet@172640	HORATIO	You will lose this wager, my lord.
hamlet@172683
hamlet@172684	HAMLET	I do not think so: since he went into France, I
hamlet@172739		have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
hamlet@172792		odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
hamlet@172845		about my heart: but it is no matter.
hamlet@172883
hamlet@172884	HORATIO	Nay, good my lord,--
hamlet@172913
hamlet@172914	HAMLET	It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
hamlet@172965		gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.
hamlet@173013
hamlet@173014	HORATIO	If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
hamlet@173070		forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
hamlet@173122		fit.
hamlet@173128
hamlet@173129	HAMLET	Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
hamlet@173182		providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
hamlet@173234		'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
hamlet@173286		now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the
hamlet@173332		readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
hamlet@173385		leaves, what is't to leave betimes?

hamlet@173580
hamlet@173581		[KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's]
hamlet@173631
hamlet@173632	HAMLET	Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
hamlet@173686		But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
hamlet@173725		This presence knows,
hamlet@173747		And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
hamlet@173797		With sore distraction. What I have done,
hamlet@173839		That might your nature, honour and exception
hamlet@173885		Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
hamlet@173930		Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
hamlet@173975		If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
hamlet@174014		And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
hamlet@174061		Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
hamlet@174105		Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
hamlet@174150		Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
hamlet@174193		His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
hamlet@174230		Sir, in this audience,
hamlet@174254		Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
hamlet@174295		Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
hamlet@174343		That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
hamlet@174388		And hurt my brother.
hamlet@174410
hamlet@174411	LAERTES	I am satisfied in nature,
hamlet@174445		Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
hamlet@174494		To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
hamlet@174536		I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
hamlet@174579		Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
hamlet@174625		I have a voice and precedent of peace,
hamlet@174665		To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
hamlet@174711		I do receive your offer'd love like love,
hamlet@174754		And will not wrong it.
hamlet@174778
hamlet@174779	HAMLET	I embrace it freely;
hamlet@174807		And will this brother's wager frankly play.
hamlet@174852		Give us the foils. Come on.

hamlet@174882	LAERTES	Come, one for me.
hamlet@174908

hamlet@175015		Stick fiery off indeed.
hamlet@175040
hamlet@175041	LAERTES	You mock me, sir.
hamlet@175067
hamlet@175068	HAMLET	No, by this hand.

hamlet@175157		You know the wager?
hamlet@175178
hamlet@175179	HAMLET	Very well, my lord
hamlet@175205		Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.
hamlet@175256
hamlet@175257	KING CLAUDIUS	I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
hamlet@175311		But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
hamlet@175362
hamlet@175363	LAERTES	This is too heavy, let me see another.
hamlet@175410
hamlet@175411	HAMLET	This likes me well. These foils have all a length?

hamlet@175577		If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
hamlet@175618		Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
hamlet@175660		Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
hamlet@175706		The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
hamlet@175755		And in the cup an union shall he throw,
hamlet@175796		Richer than that which four successive kings

hamlet@178576	KING CLAUDIUS	O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
hamlet@178632
hamlet@178633	HAMLET	Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
hamlet@178687		Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
hamlet@178730		Follow my mother.
hamlet@178749
hamlet@178750		[KING CLAUDIUS dies]
hamlet@178772
hamlet@178773	LAERTES	                  He is justly served;
hamlet@178820		It is a poison temper'd by himself.
hamlet@178857		Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
hamlet@178902		Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
hamlet@178950		Nor thine on me.
hamlet@178968
hamlet@178969		[Dies]
hamlet@178977
hamlet@178978	HAMLET	Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
hamlet@179029		I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
hamlet@179073		You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
hamlet@179121		That are but mutes or audience to this act,
hamlet@179166		Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
hamlet@179213		Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
hamlet@179261		But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
hamlet@179297		Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
hamlet@179341		To the unsatisfied.
hamlet@179362
hamlet@179363	HORATIO	Never believe it:
hamlet@179389		I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
hamlet@179430		Here's yet some liquor left.
hamlet@179460
hamlet@179461	HAMLET	As thou'rt a man,
hamlet@179486		Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
hamlet@179536		O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
hamlet@179574		Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
hamlet@179627		If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
hamlet@179668		Absent thee from felicity awhile,
hamlet@179703		And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
hamlet@179753		To tell my story.
hamlet@179772
hamlet@179773		[March afar off, and shot within]
hamlet@179808
hamlet@179809		What warlike noise is this?
hamlet@179838
hamlet@179839	OSRIC	Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
hamlet@179895		To the ambassadors of England gives
hamlet@179932		This warlike volley.
hamlet@179954
hamlet@179955	HAMLET	O, I die, Horatio;
hamlet@179981		The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
hamlet@180028		I cannot live to hear the news from England;
hamlet@180074		But I do prophesy the election lights
hamlet@180113		On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
hamlet@180152		So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
hamlet@180202		Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
hamlet@180246
hamlet@180247		[Dies]
hamlet@180255
hamlet@180256	HORATIO	Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
hamlet@180315		And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
hamlet@180361		Why does the drum come hither?
hamlet@180393
hamlet@180394		[March within]
hamlet@180410
hamlet@180411		[Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors,
hamlet@180456		and others]
hamlet@180469
hamlet@180470	PRINCE FORTINBRAS	Where is this sight?
hamlet@180509
hamlet@180510	HORATIO	What is it ye would see?
hamlet@180543		If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
hamlet@180590
hamlet@180591	PRINCE FORTINBRAS	This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
hamlet@180652		What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
hamlet@180697		That thou so many princes at a shot
hamlet@180734		So bloodily hast struck?
hamlet@180760
hamlet@180761	First Ambassador	The sight is dismal;
hamlet@180799		And our affairs from England come too late:
hamlet@180844		The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
hamlet@180897		To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
hamlet@180940		That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
hamlet@180985		Where should we have our thanks?
hamlet@181019
hamlet@181020	HORATIO	Not from his mouth,
hamlet@181048		Had it the ability of life to thank you:
hamlet@181090		He never gave commandment for their death.
hamlet@181134		But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
hamlet@181181		You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
hamlet@181230		Are here arrived give order that these bodies
hamlet@181277		High on a stage be placed to the view;
hamlet@181317		And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
hamlet@181362		How these things came about: so shall you hear
hamlet@181410		Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
hamlet@181450		Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
hamlet@181495		Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
hamlet@181542		And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
hamlet@181581		Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
hamlet@181629		Truly deliver.
hamlet@181645
hamlet@181646	PRINCE FORTINBRAS	                  Let us haste to hear it,
hamlet@181707		And call the noblest to the audience.
hamlet@181746		For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
hamlet@181789		I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
hamlet@181836		Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
hamlet@181883
hamlet@181884	HORATIO	Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
hamlet@181934		And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
hamlet@181985		But let this same be presently perform'd,
hamlet@182028		Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance
hamlet@182082		On plots and errors, happen.
hamlet@182112
hamlet@182113	PRINCE FORTINBRAS	Let four captains
hamlet@182149		Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
hamlet@182193		For he was likely, had he been put on,
hamlet@182233		To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
hamlet@182285		The soldiers' music and the rites of war
hamlet@182327		Speak loudly for him.
hamlet@182350		Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
hamlet@182392		Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
hamlet@182439		Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
hamlet@182468
hamlet@182469		[A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead
hamlet@182514		bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off]
