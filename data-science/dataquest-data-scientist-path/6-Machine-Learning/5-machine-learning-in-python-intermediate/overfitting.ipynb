To explore overfitting, we'll use a dataset on cars which dataset contains 7 numerical features that could have an effect on a car's fuel efficiency:\n",

    "* `horsepower` -- the [horsepower](http://bit.ly/29sDwVU) of the engine.\n",
    "* `weight` -- the weight of the car.\n",
    "* `acceleration` -- the acceleration of the car.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Bias** describes error that results in bad assumptions about the learning algorithm. \n",
    "* For example, assuming that only one feature, like a car's weight, relates to a car's fuel efficiency will lead you to fit a simple, univariate regression model that will result in high bias.\n",
    "* The error rate will be high since a car's fuel efficiency is affected by many other factors besides just its weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variance** describes error that occurs because of the variability of a model's predicted values.\n",
    "* If we were given a dataset with 1000 features on each car and used every single feature to train an incredibly complicated multivariate regression model, we will have low bias but high variance.\n",

    "## Bias-variance tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "We've discussed before how overfitting generally happens when a model performs well on a training set but doesn't generalize well to new data. A key nuance here is that you should think of overfitting as a relative term. Between any 2 models, one will overfit more than the other one.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the [bias variance tradeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff) is critical to understanding overfitting. Every process has some amount of inherent noise that's unobservable. Overfit models tend to capture the noise as well as the signal in a dataset.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Scott Fortman Roe's [blog post on the bias-variance tradeoff](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html) has a wonderful image that describes this tradeoff:\n",
    "\n",
    "![http://i.imgur.com/2xqTu46.png](http://i.imgur.com/2xqTu46.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can approximate the bias of a model by training a few different models from the same class (linear regression in this case) using different features on the same dataset and calculating their error scores. For regression, we can use mean absolute error, mean squared error, or R-squared.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the variance of the predicted values for each model we train and we'll observe an increase in variance as we build more complex, multivariate models.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "While an extremely simple, univariate linear regression model will underfit, an extremely complicated, multivariate linear regression model will overfit. Depending on the problem you're working on, there's a happy middle ground that will help you construct reliable and useful predictive models.<br>\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "While the higher order multivariate models overfit in relation to the lower order multivariate models, the in-sample error and out-of-sample didn't deviate by much. The best model was around **50%** more accurate than the simplest model. On the other hand, the overall variance increased around **25%** as we increased the model complexity. This is a really good starting point, but your work is not done! The increased variance with the increased model complexity means that your model will have more unpredictable performance on truly new, unseen data.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were working on this problem on a data science team, you'd need to confirm the predictive accuracy of the model using completely new, unobserved data (e.g. maybe from cars from later years). Since often you can't wait until a model is deployed in the wild to know how well it works, the exploration we did in this mission helps you approximate a model's real world performance."

So far, we've mostly dealt with supvervised machine learning models to solve regression and classification problems. In the next mission, we'll explore an **unsupervised machine learning** technique called **k-means clustering**."
