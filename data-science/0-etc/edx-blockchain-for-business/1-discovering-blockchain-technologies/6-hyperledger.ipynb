    "If you look at **permissionless blockchains**, like the Bitcoin blockchain or the Ethereum blockchain, **anyone can join the network**, as well as write and read transactions. The actors in the system are not known, which means **there could be some malicious actors within the network**.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperledger reduces these security risks and ensures that only the parties that want to transact are the ones that are part of the transaction and, rather than displaying the record of the transactions to the whole network, they remain visible only to the parties involved. So, Hyperledger provides all the capabilities of the blockchain architecture - **data privacy, information sharing, immutability, with a full stack of security protocols** - all for the enterprise."
