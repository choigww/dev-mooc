    "There are certain factors to consider when evaluating blockchain distributed ledger technology for your business. How many participants are in your system? What is the geographical distribution of the participants? What sort of performance requirements do you have? Defining the rules, risks, and responsibilities of each party in your blockchain system is useful as you consider transferring a database to a decentralized environment such as one of the Hyperledger frameworks. Blockchain is best suited for business applications where one or more of the following conditions apply:\n",

    "* There is a **need for a shared common database**\n",
    "* The parties involved with the process have conflicting incentives, or **do not have trust among participants**\n",

    "* There are **currently trusted third parties involved in the process** that facilitate interactions between multiple parties who must trust the third party. This could include *escrow services, data feed providers, licensing authorities, or a notary public*\n",
