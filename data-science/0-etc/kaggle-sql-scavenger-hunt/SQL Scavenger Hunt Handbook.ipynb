For many databases out there, SQL is the *only* way to access the information in them and, as a result, it's an important skill for any data scientist or aspiring data scientist. (You don't need to take my word on this one: in our survey of data scientists we found that SQL was [the third most popular software tool for data science](https://www.kaggle.com/surveys/2017), right after Python and R.)\n\n> **Why learn SQL?**: If you're currently looking for a data science job, being able to show that you're comfortable with SQL will open up more job opportunities for you. If you're currently *doing* data science, brushing up on your SQL skills will help you access more data sources and make it easier to get a subset of a database to work with locally. Plus, it's fun! :)\n\n[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) is a Google Cloud product for storing and accessing very large databases very quickly. We've recently started making [some BigQuery datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?filetype=bigQuery) accessible via Kaggle. Since SQL is the easiest way to access these data in these datasets they make the perfect playground to help you get comfortable with this language.\n\n>  Because the datasets on BigQuery can be very large, there are some restrictions on how much data you can access. The good news is that **each Kaggle user can scan 5TB every 30 days for free.** The bad news is that If you go over your quota you're going to have to wait for it to reset. \n\nDon't worry, though: in this handbook we'll teach you how to be careful when looking at BigQuery data to make sure you don't accidentally go over your quota."

I'm going to cover:\n\n* Getting your notebook set up\n* Checking the structure of the dataset (to help you when you want to write queries)\n* How to check the size of a query before you run it (to avoid accidentally asking for waaaay more data than you wanted)\n* How to run your first query! \n* How to save the data from your query as a .csv to use later\n\nI'm *not* going to cover all the intricacies of SQL. That's what the next five days of the Scavenger Hunt are for!\n\n## Getting set up\n___\nThe first step is to start a kernel using one of the BigQuery datasets as the data source. You can find these datasets by going to the [Datasets page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and selecting \"BigQuery\" from the \"File Types\" drop down menu at the top of the list of datasets. (Alternatively, you can follow [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?filetype=bigQuery).) \n\nOnce you've picked a BigQuery dataset, head to the dataset page for it and start a new kernel on it by hitting the \"New Kernel\" button, just as you would with any other dataset. Right now, you can only use BigQuery databases with Python kernels.\n\n> **Can you work with BigQuery in R kernels?** Right now, you can only work with BigQuery in Python kernels, so make sure you don't accidentally start an R kernel instead. If you want to do your analysis in R (which is my personal preference) you can save the data you query as an output file and then add that to a new kernel. We'll go over how to do that later in this notebook. :)\n\nIn order to make your life easier, we've put together a Python package called `bq_helper` and pre-loaded it into kernels. It has some helper functions for getting data out of BigQuery that will simplify the process of getting data. If you're curious, you can check out [example kernels with more in-depth information at the end of this notebook](#Additional-information-and-resources).\n\nYou can use `bq_helper` in your kernel by importing it, like so:"

You can find this by checking out the dataset listing for your dataset and then navigating to the \"Data\" tab. For example, [here's a link to the Data tab of the Hacker News dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news/data), which is what we're going to be using in this kernel.\n\nIf you go to the link I provided, you'll notice a blue rectangle with rounded edges near the top of the page that has the following text in it: \"bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.comments\". This tells you that you're looking of a summary of the \"comments\" table in the \"hacker_news\" dataset. The addresses of BigQuery datasets look like this:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/l11gdKx.png)\n\nWe will need to pass this information to BigQueryHelper in order to create our helper object. The active_project argument takes the BigQuery info, which is currently \"bigquery-public-data\" for all the BigQuery datasets on Kaggle. The dataset_name argument takes the name of the dataset we've added to our query. In this case it's \"hacker_news\". So we can create our BigQueryHelper object like so:"

You can do this using the \"Publish\" button (if you have the old editor) or the \"New Snapshot\" button (if you have the new editor). Both are in the upper right hand corner of the editor.\n\nOnce your notebook has compiled and your file is ready, it will show up under the \"Output\" tab of your notebook. (You should see an Output tab for this notebook with the file we just wrote to a .csv in it.) From there you can download it, or you can add the notebook with the output file as a data source to a new kernel and import the file to your notebook as you would any other .csv file. \n\n> *It can take a couple minutes for the Output tab to show up as your notebook compiles, especially if your file was very large. If you don't see it right away, give it a little bit and it should show up.*\n\nAnd that's all you need to get started getting data from BigQuery datasets on Kaggle!

Until working at a bigger scale suddenly it makes your problems bigger too, like [this poor professor whose experiment racked up an unexpected $1000 bill](https://www.wired.com/2012/04/aws-bill-in-minutes/). Although Kaggle isn't charging for accessing BigQuery datasets, following these best practices can help you avoid trouble down the line. If you'd like to learn more, you can check out [all the BigQuery best practices here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/best-practices).\n\n* *Avoid using the asterisk *(**) in your queries.* As you might have seen before in regular expressions, the asterisk means “everything”. While this may be okay with smaller datasets, if you send a query to a 4 terabyte dataset and ask for “everything” you're going to scan waaaaay more than you bargained for (or that a kernel can handle).\n* *For initial exploration, look at just part of the table instead of the whole thing.* If you're just curious to see what data's in a table, preview it instead of scanning the whole table. We've included a method, `BigQueryHelper.head()`, in our helper package to help with this. Like `head()` in Pandas or R, it will just return the first few rows for you to look at.\n* *Double-check the size of complex queries.* If you're planning on running what might be a large query, either estimate the size first or run it using the `BigQueryHelper.query_to_pandas_safe()` method.\n* *Be cautious about joining tables.* In particular, avoid joining a table with itself (i.e. a self-join) and try to avoid joins that return a table that's larger than the ones you're joining together. (If you want to double-check yourself, you can try the join on just the heads of the tables involved.)\n* *Don't rely on LIMIT*: One of the things that can be confusing when working with BigQuery datasets is the difference between the data you *scan* and the data you actually *get back* especially since it's the first one that actually counts against your quota. When you do something like select a column with LIMIT = 10, you'll only get 10 results back... but you'll actually be scanning the whole column. It's not a big deal if your table has 1000 rows, but it's a much bigger deal if it has 10,000,000 rows!"
